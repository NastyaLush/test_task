Bitcoin Spot ETF: BlackRock files purchase request with SEC,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-08 00:06:00,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) demonstrates remarkable performance in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Amidst an explosion in demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock has engaged in a diversification strategy to meet this demand. Hence their request to purchase ETFs from the American financial regulator.
A plan to purchase Bitcoin ETFs to support a BlackRock fund
According to recent information, financial giant BlackRock has filed an application with the SEC to purchase additional Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The application actually covers the company’s Global Allocation Fund.




According to the SEC filing, it may invest in exchange-traded products (ETPs) that track the performance of bitcoin (BTC), including those sponsored by companies affiliated with BlackRock.
However, it will only consider ETFs listed and traded on national securities exchanges. In other words, it will cover only regulated products allowed to be traded on national securities exchanges, thus offering a certain level of security.
It’s worth noting that the application for the Global Allocation Fund follows another recent request. It concerns the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund which BlackRock is trying to reinvigorate. This fund aims to provide competitive returns in comparison to global equities with lower risk.

The situation of BlackRock in the Bitcoin ETF market
The recent application to purchase Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock is part of a context. The firm is simply winning its bet on the leading cryptocurrency via the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC), its spot Bitcoin ETF.
It is currently the most high-performing ETF in the market. A performance that has sparked increased interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Last week was marked by unprecedented performances for all Bitcoin ETFs, with prices reaching new heights.
In these circumstances, BlackRock is clearly deploying a strategy aimed at diversifying its portfolio to further capitalize on the potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly that of bitcoin. This, by offering the best opportunities to its clients.
Note that for the time being, the SEC has not yet approved BlackRock’s request for additional ETFs for the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. The decision is up to the commission which will review the merits of the request before reaching a conclusion.

Bitcoin Options Market Surge Signals Investor Optimism,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 00:06:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Bitcoin Options Market Surge Signals Investor Optimism
Bitcoin (BTC) options market activity, especially the surge in out-of-the-money (OTM) call options, shows a rise in sentiment reminiscent of the excitement seen in 2021, according to Deribit’s market data. The leading crypto options exchange Deribit has reported significant interest in the Bitcoin call option at the $200,000 level, which is currently trading at about three times the current market rate of Bitcoin.
Investors Anticipate Bitcoin Surpassing $200,000
The recent rise in Bitcoin’s price has paralleled a record surge in interest in the largest crypto options market, fueling excitement among investors and traders. According to Deribit Metrics, the $200,000 Bitcoin call option saw significant interest on Friday, with nominal open interest exceeding $20 million.
Investors are essentially betting that Bitcoin’s price will surpass this level by the end of the year by purchasing call options at the $200,000 strike price expiring on December 31, 2024. Call options give buyers the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, reflecting the bullish outlook in the market.
Price Rises with Major Shift in Supply-Demand Dynamics
The popularity of the $200,000 call option reflects sentiments seen during the previous rally when Bitcoin rose above $60,000 in 2021. The interest in such deep OTM call options is based on the prevailing consensus that the upcoming Bitcoin block reward halving will decrease supply, potentially tipping the supply-demand dynamics in favor of the bulls and possibly driving prices to six-figure territory.
The supply-demand balance has significantly changed with Wall Street’s adoption of US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), contributing to a demand-favorable ratio of 1:10. As a result, the price recently reached new record levels above $69,000, showing a 59.7% increase since the beginning of the year and indicating rising optimism in the market.

The rally has not only revitalized the spot market but also increased activity in the options market. The total open interest in Bitcoin options on Deribit also rose to $20.4 billion, surpassing the previous peak recorded in October 2021. Similarly, the total open interest in Ethereum (ETH) options reached an all-time high of $11.66 billion.

"SHIB Rockets 128%, Kelexo Presale at $0.04 Sparks Interest: DOGE and XRP Bulls Inquire",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-08 13:40:16.167582,"The recent bounce posted by the cryptocurrency market is nothing short of electric, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) leading the way after a stunning surge of 128%. Amidst the week filled with big news, one crypto manages to stand out, maybe not in the headlines, but certainly on the price charts by pricing its presale at $0.04 a coin: Kelexo (KLXO).
Now, let’s lead on these latest developments about Shiba Inu (SHIB), Kelexo (KLXO) and inquiries from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) bulls.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Selling Pressure 
Amidst Market Correction but despite the meteoric rise, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was not immune, unlike the rest of the market, given that it had huge selling pressure on the prices slipping below the key support levels. Shiba Inu (SHIB) had first risen to such massive heights that it targeted the territory of $0.0001. However the bullish momentum has a difficult resistance with the bears, dropping the ground considerably. Whale transactions further provoked the market, moving tons of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens onto exchanges in what possibly could be indications of massive dumps.
Combined with the impact of Bitcoin (BTC) on market sentiment, these moves helped drive Shiba Inu (SHIB) down by 70%. That said, even with that, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained pretty resilient under these prevailing circumstances of trying to come back.
Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) Bulls Assess Market Opportunities 
Standing at an arm’s length away in the raging market, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) bulls are watching the price movements, which may eventually offer them the necessary growth opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently reflected in a bullish momentum, where the continued long-standing support zones should help the meme coin push higher after rejection at the resistance levels.
With the breach of critical moving averages and the indicators signaling fierce buying pressure, it definitely adds credence to the bullish argument. On its part, Ripple (XRP) is consolidating without giving an exact direction, as, on the daily time frame, most indications show a likely correction ahead against the healthy upward move pointed by the signals on the weekly chart. 
However, fundamental factors like the growth of networks, coupled with positive sentiment by some, may keep investors Ripple (XRP) bullish to some extent. Meanwhile, the legal battle with the SEC is nothing but a skirmish for granted extensions, changing the timeline of the case and, in turn, changing market sentiment.
Kelexo (KLXO) Presale Sparks Investor Interest 
Kelexo (KLXO) shines as one of the promising tokens to purchase amidst such market turbulence. They offer the token at $0.04 a coin during the presale. Branded as a blockchain-based platform for lending cryptocurrency, Kelexo (KLXO) disrupts the norm by proposing a decentralized approach.
In this regard, Kelexo (KLXO) differs from the other premier privacy coins by focusing on active user involvement and commitment to transparency within the DeFi space. Other benefits for this group of investors include free advice on the management of the account and the opportunity to receive passive cashback and income. As Kelexo (KLXO) paves the way in pioneering new ways for financial inclusion, its presale is a great scope to be part of for exponential growth for investors. 
Amidst the overall market vagaries, the value of Shiba Inu (SHIB) surging and the Kelexo (KLXO) presale with the inquiries from the Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) bulls, the phenomena both are representative of the dynamic state of the cryptocurrency landscape. Each entity presents an opportunity and challenge of its own. An investor treads on this ever-changing market and the challenge of each entity is met with equal parts optimism and prescience.

Insightful Analysis by Crypto Expert Bluntz Highlights Bitcoin Rally and Altcoin Potential,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 13:40:17.337929,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Insightful Analysis by Crypto Expert Bluntz Highlights Bitcoin Rally and Altcoin Potential
Prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader Bluntz has publicly expressed his latest insights on Bitcoin‘s and certain altcoins’ trajectories through a social media post. He begins with Bitcoin’s prospects, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon, provided it crosses the pivotal $69,000 resistance level. Despite Bitcoin’s recent 14% dip from its peak, Bluntz remains bullish, predicting a swift and significant ascent in its value.
Bitcoin Nears Breakthrough Point
Bluntz’s confidence in Bitcoin is undeterred by its recent pullback, as he envisions a fast recovery and an imminent parabolic increase. At the time of his analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $67,441, having already bounced back from a correction earlier in the month, showing a modest yet positive growth of 0.92% in a day.
Keeping an Eye on Promising Altcoins
Turning his analysis to the altcoin market, Bluntz put a spotlight on Solana (SOL), currently the fourth-largest altcoin in terms of market capitalization. He anticipates Solana’s value to climb steadily, observing that it has nearly completed a bullish five-wave pattern on its daily chart, hinting at a potential surge toward the $200 mark.
Moreover, Bluntz points out the promising signs for the SOL/BTC trading pair, noting the end of a three-wave bearish trend on the daily chart, which could signal the resurgence of its primary uptrend.
The analyst concludes with an evaluation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sei (SEI), identifying a significant reversal at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This pattern indicates a strong likelihood of an impending major uptrend, with Fibonacci levels historically serving as reliable indicators of price action.

BlackRock Eyes Integration of Direct Bitcoin ETFs in Investment Strategy,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 13:40:18.534051,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: BlackRock Eyes Integration of Direct Bitcoin ETFs in Investment Strategy
BlackRock, a premier global asset manager, has announced intentions to acquire direct Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for its Global Allocation Fund, MALOX. This move, as revealed in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to diversify the fund’s holdings by adding physically-backed Bitcoin products. The fund, standing at $17.8 billion in assets under management, is positioning itself to include shares of exchange-traded products (ETPs) that directly hold Bitcoin and mirror its market performance.
Strategic Expansion into Cryptocurrency
Under the new plan, MALOX could potentially invest in BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as well as offerings from other ETP issuers. The Global Allocation Fund, which invests across various asset classes including equities and money market instruments, is known for its managed investment policy encompassing U.S. and international securities.
Growth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Holdings
This strategic interest in Bitcoin is not confined to MALOX alone. Following a similar filing for the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has shown significant growth, with a Bitcoin holdings increase of over 7,000% within less than two months. As of March 7, the Fund’s Bitcoin assets were valued at $12.6 billion. This remarkable trajectory underscores BlackRock’s increasing focus on digital assets, as the firm also pursues regulatory discussions for a direct Ethereum ETF.
With industry speculation about the potential for a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF in 2024, BlackRock’s proactive filing for an iShares Ethereum Trust in late 2023 signifies the firm’s commitment to expanding its crypto-related offerings, amid a regulatory landscape that has only recently begun to accommodate such investment vehicles.
As BlackRock continues to adapt its investment strategies to incorporate digital assets, the financial world closely watches for potential industry shifts and the wider adoption of cryptocurrency within mainstream investment funds.

UK Researchers Probe Intellectual Property Concerns in the Metaverse,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 13:40:19.617619,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: UK Researchers Probe Intellectual Property Concerns in the Metaverse
A team of UK researchers has conducted an in-depth analysis of how intellectual property (IP) laws mesh with emerging metaverse technologies. Their research, released by the UK government on March 7th, delves into the adequacy of existing IP frameworks and puts forth suggestions for improvement in the context of the metaverse.
Challenges Identified in Virtual Environments
The study points out specific issues related to the enforcement of IP in the metaverse, such as regulating collaborative creation and the use of technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). The researchers note that the metaverse’s interoperability is a key avenue for potential copyright infringement, calling for strategies to limit unauthorized content sharing.
Interoperability, a hallmark of metaverse platforms, presents difficulties in controlling IP. Moreover, the blockchain’s permanent records challenge the flexible management of IP rights, underscored by concerns over property disputes and the dismantling of metaverse agreements.
Exploring AI and Governance Hurdles
The incorporation of AI in the governance of these virtual spaces also raises critical issues. The study suggests that algorithmic enforcement of IP rights is susceptible to misuse without human supervision to safeguard authenticity. In addition, AI-generated content complicates the assertion of IP claims, with the research underscoring that works assisted by AI could still fall under IP protection.
The researchers call for clarification on a range of pressing topics, from traditional IP domains like copyrights and trademarks to novel elements such as user-generated content, virtual property, and NFT-related legalities in the metaverse. They assert that the metaverse demands tailored IP approaches for both governance and practical application.

Bitcoin Mining Profitability Skyrockets as Daily Revenue Peaks,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 13:40:20.882403,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Bitcoin Mining Profitability Skyrockets as Daily Revenue Peaks
Bitcoin‘s price has been exploring new heights, recently achieving record values. In parallel to this uptick, the cryptocurrency‘s miners have seen unprecedented daily earnings. An increase in transaction activity has accompanied the surge in mining revenue, highlighting a robust period for the digital currency network.
Surge in Miner Earnings
Data from Glassnode has shown a remarkable rise in Bitcoin miner revenue on March 5th, with daily earnings hitting the highest point since April 2021 at $75.9 million. Although there has been a slight reduction to around $62 million, current figures remain significantly elevated compared to those seen since December 2021. This upsurge correlates with an uptick in daily Bitcoin transaction volume, which, according to Santiment, exceeded $102 billion on February 6th, marking a first in over a year.
Despite Bitcoin’s volume settling over $55 billion, a decline in miner reserves suggests that miners might be capitalizing on the increased fees by selling off their holdings. CryptoQuant data reflects this potential trend, with miner reserves dipping slightly from early in the month and the beginning of February.
Current State of Bitcoin’s Market Value
The trend of miners possibly selling their Bitcoin in response to the price surge has not impacted the currency’s value just yet. However, a continued sell-off could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s market price. A recent evaluation reveals that Bitcoin may be poised for a correction following its march past the $68,000 mark on March 4th.
Currently, trading around $66,700, Bitcoin has sustained a steady increase, including a near 1% rise consistent with the prior session’s growth of 3.6%. Despite these gains, indicators such as the relative strength index suggest the cryptocurrency might be encountering an overbought condition, which could precede a potential price adjustment.

Bitcoin ‘deep value is over’ says analyst as BTC price nears $70K line,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 13:34:24.044639,"Bitcoin (BTC) has left its “deep value” zone as on-chain data points to a seismic shift in BTC price dynamics.
In an X thread on March 7, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, hailed a “new chapter” for the market.
Bitcoin “fairly priced” for first time in two years
Bitcoin at all-time highs is a serious transformation from BTC price action just months ago, but on-chain analysis shows that bulls have simply redressed the balance.
At around $70,000, Edwards shows, Bitcoin is “fairly priced” in terms of the amount of energy used by miners to participate in the network.
Capriole’s Bitcoin Energy Price metric shows the phenomenon playing out for the first time since late 2020.
Edwards describes the metric as “Bitcoin’s intrinsic value priced from the pure Joules of energy into the network only.”
“No wacky formulas, no power laws,” he explained.

 “Energy alone maps the fair value of Bitcoin from inception. Currently at $70K, making Bitcoin fairly valued for the first time in 2 yrs.”

Energy price is just one example of an extensive list of market gauges that are now pointing toward even higher BTC prices.
Even miners, currently selling significant amounts of BTC despite the upcoming block subsidy halving, are enjoying a return to solid profit margins.
“Bitcoin broke out of the cost of production in recent months, along with the Ordinals fee boost, Bitcoin Mining is once again highly profitable,” Edwards wrote.

 “As you can see, these breakouts often lead to repricing a lot higher. But the era of value Bitcoin is over.”

On that note, Edwards believes that those waiting for bargain Bitcoin buying opportunities have missed their opportunity.
“Bitcoin deep value is gone. That ship has sailed. You had 2 years to pick up undervalued Bitcoin. Instead an exciting new chapter has begun,” he concluded.

 “Welcome to the Bitcoin Momentum era.”

Concerns over BTC price correction linger
As Cointelegraph continues to report, not everyone is feeling optimistic about what the immediate future holds.

Some see all-time highs as a watershed that will instigate a protracted correction, contrasting with the idea that institutional demand will buoy the market further.
Updating his view of how events could pan out in the coming few months, Venturefounder, a contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, suggested that both Bitcoin and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), need to make a more definitive breach of current highs.
He referenced the upcoming decision over whether or not to allow spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.
“If BTC and $ETH fail to make a definitive new ATH breakout in March, I think it’s more likely we see more downside in April/May leading to the halving and ETH ETF approval,” he forecast.
Venturefounder added that “March is probably the most important month of this cycle following such bullish February month.”

"Terraform Labs Saga Continues: Do Kwon’s Fate Hangs Between Montenegro, South Korea, and the U.S",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 13:34:25.148952,"The post Terraform Labs Saga Continues: Do Kwon’s Fate Hangs Between Montenegro, South Korea, and the U.S appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
US Prosecutors are aiming to continue seeking the extradition of the Terraform Labs Co-founder, Do Kwon, in spite of Montenegro’s High Court ruling of handing him over to South Korea to face charges over the $40 billion TerraUSD stablecoin collapse that had taken place in the year 2022. 
After Terra’s collapse, Kwon managed to escape South Korean authorities only until he was arrested in Montenegro while trying to travel with a fake passport. Kwon got charged with the former Terra executive Han Chang-joon, who was extradited to South Korea in February.
Kwon will reportedly stay back in Montenegro, for a four-month sentence over possessing false documents. Following which, he is likely to be sent back to South Korea, as per Kwon’s Montenegrin attorney.
Some of the crypto lawyers who are closely following the case raised questions over Kwon being sent back to South Korea. Terrence Yang, a Managing Director at Swan Bitcoin and former counsel at Merrill Lynch, termed this decision as ‘travesty’. Yang underscored that the US has successfully prosecuted people involved in significant collapses of crypto exchanges, an instance being Sam Bankman of FTX.
Yang stated that – “The US probably has the largest number of victims by both number and dollar amount. It seems a bit ridiculous for the Montenegro court to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea, where he might get acquitted or a comically light sentence as opposed to the United States.” 
The U.S. and South Korea have both requested his extradition, while the Montenegrin authorities will make the decision on where he needs to be sent.
At the same time, the FTX Co-founder, Sam Bankman Fried, will potentially face decades of imprisonment over fraud in New York.","['UTED', 'BTC', 'LUNA']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eae9b3fad8876e25553f70/
Cardano’s ADA to Spike +30% If Bulls Can Defend This Broken Resistance,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 13:34:26.202367,"According to Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian), a prominent crypto analyst, Cardano’s native token ADA has made a significant move, breaking out and reaching the $0.75 level. Sssebi expressed optimism, questioning, “$ADA is back to $0.75 and is now breaking out. $0.80+ is on the horizon. Can we see $1 this weekend?”


Technical Analysis Suggests Potential for $1 Target
Further analysis of ADA’s price action reveals that the relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 63, indicating that the price still has room to run higher. If the bulls can continue to defend and support the critical resistance level that ADA has broken through, the cryptocurrency could potentially reach the coveted $1 mark.
Current Retracement, Bulls Need to Close Higher
However, it’s important to note that at the time of writing, ADA’s price is presently bearish, trading at around $0.73 as it experiences a retracement. For the bullish momentum to continue and potentially push ADA towards the $1 target, the bulls need to ensure that the daily candle closes higher, defending the broken resistance level.

As the crypto market continues to recover, all eyes are on ADA and whether the bulls can sustain their momentum, defend the broken resistance, and potentially push the token towards the highly anticipated $1 mark.

"Conflux Network introduces AxHKD, Hong Kong Dollar-Backed Stablecoin (8 Mar)",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Chainwire,2024-03-08 13:34:27.385410,"Toronto, Canada, March 8th, 2024, Chainwire 
Conflux Network, the only regulatory compliant public blockchain in China, today announces its pivotal role in assisting the successful beta-testing of the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)-backed stablecoin, AxHKD. Built by local fintech company AnchorX, the stablecoin will be launched on Conflux Network initially, followed by Ethereum.
Conflux will provide the underlying technology with its superior scalability, security, low latency and cost-effectiveness. With this launch, AnchorX envisions becoming the most trusted provider of digital currency solutions in Asia, empowering reliable and efficient global exchanges.
AxHKD, will be launched initially on the Conflux public blockchain, and utilizes world-class distributed ledger technology and robust cybersecurity measures. It ensures a 1:1 peg to the HKD, backed by high-quality liquid asset reserves. These reserves are protected by a segregated trust arrangement and held by regulated financial institutions in Hong Kong. OKLink Trust, a strategic partner of AnchorX, provides the custodian services for the AxHKD issuance. 
AnchorX targets two primary applications for AxHKD. Firstly, as a catalyst for global payments, AxHKD enhances cross-border transactions between Hong Kong/mainland China and the global market. This is particularly beneficial for Belt and Road partners with less developed banking infrastructures. Secondly, AxHKD acts as a reliable fiat-on-chain instrument for virtual asset trading, paving the way for innovation in Real-World Assets and bridging the gap between traditional and digital assets in Hong Kong. 
The project is backed by Industry leaders from both the traditional finance and blockchain technology space including Hony Capital, a leading investment management firm in China overseeing over USD 16 billion in assets.
The announcement follows the recent initiatives by Hong Kong authorities to propose a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. On December 27, 2023, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, in conjunction with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (“HKMA”), released a Consultation Paper to gather public comments on the proposed legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers. This paper builds on the Discussion Paper released by the HKMA in January 2022 and the subsequent Conclusion Paper in January 2023.
Byron Wong, the Chief Compliance Officer at AnchorX, commented on the company's unwavering commitment to meeting regulatory standards,  ""Hong Kong has adopted one of the most proactive approaches to stablecoin regulation globally. We want to ensure that AxHKD tightly aligns with the proposed stablecoin standards. We will also explore applying for participation in the upcoming regulatory sandbox and hope to contribute our first-hand practical insights to the formation of a successful stablecoin regulatory regime.""
Fan Long, Founder of Conflux, commented ""We're thrilled to partner with AnchorX for the launch of AxHKD on Conflux Network. This collaboration represents a significant milestone in the fusion of traditional finance and the Web3 realm, enhancing the practicality of digital currencies for everyday transactions. AxHKD is poised to play a pivotal role in weaving the Hong Kong Dollar into the fabric of the Web3 ecosystem, driving innovation and financial inclusion.""

Streaming Genius DeeStream Eyes 50X Gains with AVAX & LINK Amidst SHIB Market Buzz,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-08 13:34:28.489517,"There is so much profit to be made in the cryptocurrency industry, and you just need to know where to look. The current bull run has seen many projects soar in price and is poised to continue. However, these projects are not all growing at the same rate. While some coins are making gains of 2x, others are seeing as much as 5x.
Yet it is DeeStream (DST) that seems to be the center of attention. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen tremendous progress, while Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have moved up as well, but with a potential for 50x gains, investors are beginning to rush into DeeStream (DST).
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is skyrocketing
Perhaps one of the best-performing coins is Shiba Inu (SHIB). The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has increased by over 343.92% in the previous week. Its growth on the market has gathered more investors, and its market cap is currently $25.2 billion. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00004319, representing more than 288% growth in the past week.
Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) see a mild increase
The past week saw Avalanche (AVAX) rise by more than 8.26%. The current price, as of the time of writing, is $42.81, representing more than 18.96% increase from the previous month. 
Chainlink (LINK), on the other hand, has grown by about 7.66% in the last 7 days. Currently, a token of Chainlink (LINK) is selling for $20.75, meaning it has seen more than 14.06% growth in the past month. 
With DeeStream (DST) having a potential for 50x gains, Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) holders are contemplating the best time to make the switch. 
The Endless Possibilities of DeeStream (DST)
DeeStream (DST) launches into a previously untapped market in the cryptocurrency industry. Sure, video streaming platforms have been available for a while now, but until DeeStream (DST), no one has explored the possibilities of combining this lucrative market and blockchain technology. 
DST is the first Web3 platform with a fully decentralized streaming model connecting content creators and fans from across the world. The platform employs a unique revenue-sharing formula that sees presale token holders earn revenue from the fees generated on the platform, which is proportional to their holdings. 
Aside from its massive gains, presale token holders also get the opportunity to guide the platform to even more profit as each one can contribute, suggest and vote for future changes on the platform. Investors can buy into DeeStream (DST) by getting a token for just $0.04. The total supply of DeeStream (DST) is 300 million tokens, and liquidity is locked for life, making DeeStream safe for investors.
Experts predict that DeeStream will return a profit of at least 50x gains before the end of the year, meaning these early stages are the best times to get into the project.

This comes following the burning of a record amount of more than 50 million RUNE. The burning mechanism contributes to the scarcity of RUNE tokens, which, in turn, stimulates demand and potentially leads to an increase in its price.

THORChain Price Bulls Sustain The Bullish Stance




   RUNEUSD Chart Analysis Source: Tradingview.com
  

The THORChain price has continued to rise and recorded massive gains since mid-October, last year. However, the stance by the bulls faced some rejection at $7.36, allowing the price to trend back through a retrace.
The price movements allowed the price to form a cup and handle pattern, as the bulls continue to show resilience to push the price even higher.
RUNE is trading well above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), a confirmation of the sustained bullish momentum.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also trending upward within the overbought region at 72, which is a signal of investor optimism as they take more buying positions.



Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also bullish, as the moving average line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange), representing a bullish crossover. Investors often use a bullish crossover as a signal to make more buys.
Additionally, the green bars on the histogram are starting to form over the neutral line, which shows that the current momentum is positive. The Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (green) crosses above the trigger line (orange), which is a confirmation of a bullish moving average crossover, indicating an incoming bullish trend.
THORChain Price Prediction
The THORChain price long-term price Analysis indicates that the price is currently on a strong bullish trend, as it breaks over the cup and handle pattern. Additionally, the MACD, RSI, and Stochastic Oscillator provide a bullish outlook for optimistic investors.
The 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross at $1.29, which encourages the bulls to rally the price, with the next target set at $8.44, a 16.38% increase from the current price.
However, the RSI and the Stochastic Oscillator indicate that the asset has already entered the overbought levels, suggesting an incoming price correction. In such a scenario, 5.06, coinciding with the 50-day SMA, would act as the next support zone.
As the RUNE price soars, investors are also looking at eTukTuk, a compelling eco-friendly crypto that investors say has what it takes to soar 10X on launch.

Over $11 Million in XRP Mysteriously Transferred From Major Exchange,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-08 13:34:30.644612,"

  Cover image via U.Today


In a startling development on the crypto market, more than $11 million worth of XRP, equivalent to 18.91 million coins, was mysteriously transferred from major cryptocurrency exchange Binance to an unidentified wallet. The major XRP transaction was highlighted by Whale Alert, a popular service that tracks significant cryptocurrency transactions.

🚨 18,916,870 #XRP (11,749,233 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/wlK9eXEpOL— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 8, 2024

This transfer comes on the heels of a similar event just yesterday, when, as previously reported by U.Today, approximately 18.34 million XRP, valued at $11.2 million at the time, was moved from Binance to an unknown destination. These back-to-back high-value withdrawals have sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, prompting a flurry of speculation and analysis.
XRP enthusiasts and analysts frequently monitor such large-scale transactions, known as ""whale movements,"" for insights into market trends. Large withdrawals from exchanges like Binance often suggest strategic movements by major players in the space. These actions can be signs of XRP accumulation, where big players are increasing their holdings in anticipation of future price increases.
XRP price movements
The timing of these transactions is particularly noteworthy given the recent performance of XRP. The current price of XRP is $0.6246, marking a slight increase of 0.11% over the last 24 hours. More impressively, the currency has surged 21.79% in the last 30 days, reflecting growing investor interest and optimism in the asset's future.
Adding to the market dynamics, data from CoinGlass indicates a significant level of trading activity surrounding XRP. In the last 24 hours, there have been $1.15 million in liquidations, with $606.22K stemming from long liquidations and $545.80K from short liquidations. These figures suggest a volatile market environment for XRP, with traders actively betting on both sides of the price movement.
Such high liquidation volumes highlight the speculative nature of the market and the high stakes involved in trading this digital currency. Considering the implications of these large-scale XRP movements, the overall sentiment in the market appears to be bullish. However, as with all investments, especially in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market, risks remain. Investors and enthusiasts alike are advised to exercise caution.","['2024', '2024', 'MM', 'XRP']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eae9b3f7d21c787abf37cd/
"Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Could Surge by Over 600%, Forecasts That Bitcoin Is ‘Close to the Finish Line’",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 13:34:31.766614,"
A closely followed crypto analyst is expressing bullish sentiment on a top-10 altcoin while updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC).
Starting with smart contract platform Solana (SOL), pseudonymous crypto strategist Altcoin Sherpa tells his 209,900 followers on the social media platform X that the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap could appreciate by roughly between 250% and 600% this cycle.
  

 “SOL: This will cleanly break all time highs this cycle, the only question is how high. $500 is probable, something obscene like $1,000 isn’t out of the question in my opinion. 
Still one of my bigger bags. $170 next level up.” 
According to the analyst’s chart, it appears that after climbing above $140, the next major resistance levels for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor are around $174 and around $202.


   Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
  

Solana, which hit an all-time high of around $260 in November of 2021, is trading for $142 at time of writing.
Moving on to the flagship digital asset, Altcoin Sherpa says it will experience immense volatility in the short term but will eventually reach a six-figure price tag this cycle.
Based on the analyst’s chart, it appears that Bitcoin could surge to just below $70,000 before plunging to around $62,000 in the near future.
 “Bitcoin is going to go to $100,000 this cycle and these short-term movements are a blip on the radar. Don’t lose your stack when we’re so close to the finish line.”

The crypto world is growing in leaps and bounds again. Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $65,000 and is on its way to match its highest price value of 2021. Many suggest that it’d break that price ceiling as well and set new records. Even speculative assets such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) have risen by 180% already.
Crypto enthusiasts, who are often also its shareholders and developers, are excited about what the future holds. Can Bitcoin (BTC) reach $100,000? What other crypto assets are worth investing in at the moment? By how much would these crypto assets double in price? These questions have sparked speculation on the direction of an industry that’s clearly on the rise.
Bitcoin (BTC) Surpasses $65,000 On Its Way To $70,000 Valuation
Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $67,120. Adding roughly $10,000 to its price valuation every week. It was about $56,000 last week and $43,000 a month ago. With an all-time high price of nearly $70,000, could we see Bitcoin (BTC) not only match this valuation again but surpass it?
Many crypto enthusiasts use Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value. During the boom-bust era of the early 2020s, Bitcoin (BTC) rose and crashed leaving the industry in chaos. Many newcomers sold. But others held their tokens and it looks to be paying off.
The Enthusiasm Of The Cardano (ADA) Community
The Cardano (ADA) blockchain platform has a reputation for being one of the most secure blockchain networks in the industry. Its peer review process of development could slow down development speed, but it sure separates the project from the pack.
Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.7629 today which is a steady rise from $0.6146 a week ago and $0.5035 four weeks ago. The vibrant Cardano (ADA) is particularly excited about the prospects of the DeeStream (DST) crypto project.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Grows In Leaps And Bounds
The speculative crypto asset Shiba Inu (SHIB), grows in leaps and bounds. At last count, it had grown 180% in March alone. And we’ve not even made it a week into the month.
The signs are there in the crypto industry. Assets and whole portfolios are on the rise. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at $0.00003224 which is a rise from $0.00001039 a week ago and $0.000009051 four weeks ago.
The Potential Of DeeStream (DST) To Grow Exponentially
DeeStream (DST) is a decentralized streaming platform that allows for better interaction between fans and streamers. There’s infrastructure for fan support and an instant payout system for professional streamers.
On the other hand, investors who buy into the project during the presale launch event get a 50:50 revenue split with governance rights. DeeStream (DST) started with a value of $0.035 but has risen to $0.040 as we speak. Speculation suggests that it could go up to 20x its value in a couple of months.

Pro-Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis pushes stablecoin bill,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 13:25:38.559472,"Pro-Bitcoin (BTC) senator Cynthia Lummis is drafting regulations for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to real-world assets to ensure stable price.
Lummis has been working jointly with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for several months on a bill aiming to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and protect investors, the American news agency Axios reported on March 7.
Citing several spokespeople for Lummis and Gillibrand’s offices, the report notes that the senators are hoping to officially announce the news following encouraging feedback from multiple stakeholders.
The staff at the New York Department of Financial Services, the Federal Reserve, Treasury and the National Economic Council have provided technical assistance on the Senate version, the report mentioned.

For Lummis and Gillibrand, the work on stablecoin regulation would not be the first foray into drafting cryptocurrency-related legislation. In July 2013, the senators announced a joint effort to reintroduce legislation aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.
Lummis has emerged as a major pro-Bitcoin lawmaker in the United States, advocating for Bitcoin before the U.S. government multiple times.
In October 2021, senator Lummis urged the U.S. government to “thank God for Bitcoin” amid U.S. President Joe Biden approving another raise of the country’s debt limit. Lummis called on the government to take advantage of Bitcoin because it’s decentralized and is not run by any government.
Lummis is also known for accumulating significant amounts of Bitcoin, buying BTC in batches of $50,000 and $100,000 in 2021.
While bullish on Bitcoin, Lummis has grown skeptical about some major stablecoins recently, including Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and the most traded cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

In October 2023, Lummis backed a massive campaign against Tether, asking the U.S. the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against the stablecoin firm amid some reports alleging that they engaged in illicit financial transactions. Tether subsequently reacted to lawmakers’ requests for DOJ action, claiming it wants to be a “world class partner” to U.S. regulators.
Most recently, Lummis has been also aggressively opposing central bank digital currencies, arguing that such digital currencies are “anti-democratic and a means of financial censorship.”

Bittensor (TAO) and Cronos (CRO) Push for Higher Prices While Experts Predict Profitable Price Ranges for Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ),COIN_MARKET_CAP,ItsBitcoinWorld,2024-03-08 13:25:39.771972,"
TLDR

The Bittensor (TAO) price is anticipated to rise above $750 in the coming months. 
Experts say that Cronos (CRO) will continue rising and trade above $0.200. 
Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) is expected to generate astronomical gains as it prepares for exchange listing. 

With the market turning bullish, Bittensor (TAO) and Cronos (CRO) have emerged as the best altcoins. On the other hand, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) is predicted to generate 100x gains as its investors await the exchange listing. Let’s learn why the experts consider TAO, CRO, and $RBLZ as the best cryptos to buy ahead of other top altcoins. 
 
Bittensor Enters Consolidation After Attaining All-Time High
The Bittensor (TAO) token began the new year in red and was down to $219.48 by January 8. Since then, as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval has led to the market eventually turning bullish, Bittensor (TAO) has also skyrocketed. By March 1, the Bittensor (TAO) token rose to an all-time high of $723.33 with a surge of 229.5%. 
Apart from the market turning bullish, the growth in the Bittensor (TAO) ecosystem also played a role in the rally. For instance, Bittensor (TAO) announced a partnership with LunarCrush on February 15. Corcel.io announced that their new Image Studio built on Bittensor (TAO) went live on February 21. 
With the Bittensor (TAO) ecosystem continuing to grow, experts are bullish on it. They predict that the Bittensor (TAO) token will rise above $750 in the coming months. 
 

 
Cronos Continues To Surge as the Market Turns Bullish
The Cronos (CRO) token was trading in red since the beginning of the year and dropped to $0.076 on January 24. Since then, the Cronos (CRO) token has reversed its downtrend as the market has rallied. On March 4, the Cronos (CRO) token was trading at $0.138 with a surge of 81.5%. 
While the market rally played a huge part in the Cronos (CRO) rally, its ecosystem growth also had a major impact. For example, Fulcrom Finance on the Cronos (CRO) network surpassed $1 billion in TVL on February 1. Cronos (CRO) released version 1.0 of its litepaper on February 22 for the upcoming Cronos zkEVM launch. 
This has resulted in the experts having a bullish outlook for the Cronos (CRO) token. They predict that the Cronos (CRO) token will continue its rally and rise above $0.200 going forward. 
 
Rebel Satoshi Teases 100x Gains as Immensely Successful Presale Ends
Rebel Satoshi is an innovative community-led memecoin project inspired by the ethos of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. Rebel Satoshi aims to disrupt the status quo and curtail the growing market centralization. The Rebel Satoshi rebellion is led by its community of Recusant members rising together against the elites. 
The Rebel Satoshi movement is built around its governance and membership token $RBLZ. The $RBLZ token is built on the Ethereum network and has a total supply of 250 million. The audacious target of Rebel Satoshi is to take the $RBLZ token to a $100 million market cap. Rebel Satoshi conducted the presale of the $RBLZ token in multiple rounds and it came to an end on February 29. 
Due to immense demand among investors, the $RBLZ token surged by 150% during the presale to $0.025. Rebel Satoshi will be launching the $RBLZ token on Uniswap and Coinstore in the coming days. This has resulted in experts predicting a massive 100x surge in $RBLZ once it is open for trading. Thus, the $RBLZ token is being rightfully touted as one of the best altcoins to buy right now.

Bitcoin Mining Revenues Hit Record Highs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 13:25:40.868058,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Bitcoin Mining Revenues Hit Record Highs
Bitcoin (BTC) price has been testing different levels while recently reaching all-time highs (ATH). Concurrently, with the new price increase, miners also witnessed the highest level of daily revenue ever.
Bitcoin Miner Revenues
An analysis of Bitcoin miner revenue from Glassnode revealed a significant increase on March 5th. The daily mining fee rose to $75.9 million, marking the highest daily revenue since April 2021. At the time of writing, the daily mining fee had fallen to approximately $62 million. Despite this decline, the fee continues to be among the highest observed since December 2021. Moreover, the increase in fees can be linked to the rise in daily transactions. An analysis of the volume chart from Santiment showed that on February 6th, BTC volume exceeded $102 billion.
This was the first instance in over a year that BTC witnessed such high volume. At the time of writing, the volume was over $55 billion. An analysis of miner reserves from CryptoQuant indicated that as fees increased, reserves experienced a decline. At the time of writing, the reserve was over 1.820 million. At the beginning of the month, the reserve was approximately 1.821 million, and at the start of February, it was around 1.827 million.

Bitcoin Price Analysis
The recent decline could indicate that miners are selling their tokens as BTC prices rise. While this has not yet affected the BTC price, more significant declines could lead to a price drop. A detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s price trend on the daily timeframe could suggest a pullback after surpassing $68,000 on March 4th.
This could mean that Bitcoin reached this level for the first time in over a year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading around $66,700, following a nearly 1% increase in value. This sustained the previous trading session’s 3.6% rise. Additionally, as indicated by data from the relative strength index (RSI), Bitcoin remained in the overbought zone.

In a startling revelation, on-chain data has unveiled a substantial surge in Shiba Inu token purchases, totaling over $10 million in the last 24 hours. Blockchain explorers have tracked the movement of a staggering 311.17 billion Shiba Inu tokens to an unknown wallet, executed in two sizable transactions.
The first transfer saw an enigmatic individual funneling 288.639 billion SHIB, valued at $9.1 million, into the anonymous wallet. Following closely behind it, a more modest transfer of 22.531 billion SHIB, equivalent to $736,080, was completed, reportedly originating from the Bitvavo exchange. Source: Etherscan

The juxtaposition of these events sparks curiosity, prompting questions about the underlying dynamics driving Shiba Inu's recent activity.

Montenegro High Court may extradite Do Kwon to South Korea after appeal — Report,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 13:15:44.292590,"The High Court in Podgorica, Montenegro has ruled that Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon should be extradited to his native South Korea rather than the United States, according to various media reports. The decision is still subject to appeal.
An appeals court overturned the High Court’s earlier decision to extradite Kwon to the United States on March 5, citing “significant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure.”
South Korea filed an extradition request in March 2023, which was initially refused in favor of the U.S.’s request filed two days prior. Kwon has been held in prison in Montenegro since his arrest at the Podgorica airport, where he was attempting to travel to Dubai using an allegedly fake Costa Rican passport.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Montenegrin authorities had been alerted to Kwon’s presence in the country by a tipster the day before his intended flight.

According to The WSJ, Kwon had expressed a preference to be extradited to South Korea, saying he would like to be closer to his family. His lawyers called into doubt the validity of the treaty that would allow Kwon’s extradition to the United States. Kwon reportedly faces a 40-year prison term in South Korea.
Lawyers for Kwon had requested that his trial in the U.S. be delayed until after his extradition to that country. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had joined in that request, asking that his U.S. trial be delayed until at least March 18. The SEC is charging both Terraform Labs and Kwon in its complaint.

Terraform Labs chief financial officer Han Chang-joon, who was arrested with Kwon at the airport, was extradited to South Korea in February.
Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on Jan. 21. The issuer of Terra’s stablecoin and the LUNA governance token collapsed in May 2022.

Intellectual Property Challenges in the Metaverse Explored by UK Researchers,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 13:15:45.455173,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Intellectual Property Challenges in the Metaverse Explored by UK Researchers
United Kingdom researchers have examined the applicability of current intellectual property laws and their adaptations to new technologies like the metaverse. The study identified shortcomings in existing laws and presented recommendations on the issue. On March 7th, the UK government published a research report titled Intellectual Property and Metaverse. The report reviewed the current literature on intellectual property laws and how they could be applied to the metaverse.
UK’s Metaverse Report Highlights
Within the scope of the study, researchers concluded that there are specific intellectual property issues in the metaverse, such as governance of intellectual property in a collaborative environment and regulation of technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence in virtual worlds. According to the report, there are numerous legal challenges in the interoperability process, including unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works. Researchers emphasized that the lack of interoperability is significant in preventing the illegal distribution of copyrighted materials.
Since interoperability is an important feature in a metaverse universe, researchers believe it could pose a challenge in managing the use and circulation of copyrighted works. Meanwhile, the unique characteristics of the blockchain field, such as immutability or protection against alteration, also pose challenges in the application of intellectual property laws. Researchers shared the following statements:

“Blockchain’s inherent resistance to change or correction weakens the ability to manage or update intellectual property rights flexibly. This is particularly concerning in the context of property disputes and when licensors or rights holders wish to exit the Metaverse, regarding the termination of agreements and rights.”


Notable Details on the Issue
The use of artificial intelligence in potential metaverse governance also brings up certain challenges. Researchers argued that the algorithmic management of violations is extremely vulnerable to misuse due to the lack of human oversight to ensure legitimacy.
Additionally, content generated by artificial intelligence presents another challenge in the enforcement of intellectual rights in the metaverse space. According to the study, relying on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of invention in content. The research highlighted examples and cases showing that works partially supported by artificial intelligence can be protected by intellectual property laws.
Researchers concluded that due to the anticipated problems in the governance of intellectual property within the metaverse, clarity is needed on numerous key issues. These issues include copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property, and legal matters related to NFTs within the metaverse. Therefore, researchers believe that intellectual property approaches need to be formulated for governance and implementation specific to the metaverse.

According to BlackRock’s application, there is a possibility of acquiring spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the Global Allocation Fund.
BlackRock has also applied to include spot bitcoin ETFs in the Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which has assets of over $36.7 billion.
BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has maintained its lead in the ETF race since its launch in January.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has announced its intention to purchase a spot Bitcoin ETF for the Global Allocation Fund.
BlackRock Reveals Plan to Acquire Spot Bitcoin ETF

According to the updated application submitted by BlackRock to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there is a possibility of acquiring spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the Global Allocation Fund.
In the application filed on Thursday, the company stated, “The Fund may invest in shares of exchange-traded products (ETPs), typically exchange-traded products that aim to reflect the price performance of bitcoin, by directly holding bitcoin (via Bitcoin ETPs). This includes shares of a Bitcoin ETP supported by an affiliate of BlackRock.” indicating that they will invest only in bitcoin ETFs listed on national securities exchanges.
According to BlackRock’s data, as of March 7, the Global Allocation Fund, which uses U.S. and foreign stocks, debt securities, and money market instruments to maximize returns, had assets under management of $17.8 billion.
Earlier this week, BlackRock also applied to include spot bitcoin ETFs in the Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which has assets of over $36.7 billion.
BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Stands Out
Meanwhile, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF, has maintained its lead in the ETF race since its launch in January. Following Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $69,000 on Tuesday, IBIT recorded a record daily inflow of $788.3 million. IBIT currently holds bitcoin worth $12.7 billion. During the success of IBIT, BlackRock also proposed the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, but the SEC postponed a decision-making process along with a similar proposal from Fidelity.

One of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, is planning to purchase spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for its Global Allocation Fund (MALOX). According to an update filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, BlackRock intends to include physically-backed Bitcoin exchange-traded products, or in other words, spot Bitcoin ETF funds, as part of MALOX.
BlackRock’s Noteworthy Move
The updated filing indicates that MALOX could purchase shares of BlackRock’s own spot Bitcoin ETF fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as well as ETF funds from other issuers. The document included the following statement:

“The Fund may purchase shares of ETPs that aim to reflect the performance of the Bitcoin price by holding Bitcoin directly, including shares of a Bitcoin ETP backed by an affiliate of BlackRock.”

The filing specified that the fund would only invest in Bitcoin ETPs that are listed and traded on national securities exchanges. Launched in 1989, the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund aims to provide investment returns through a fully managed investment policy using U.S. and foreign equity and money market securities, including companies like Microsoft, Apple, and others. As of March 7, MALOX had $17.8 billion in assets under management.

Key Details on the ETF Process
MALOX is not the only BlackRock fund that wants to hold spot Bitcoin ETF funds. The updated SEC filing came just a few days after BlackRock submitted a similar update for its Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX) on March 4. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, began trading alongside nine other spot Bitcoin ETF funds in the United States on January 11.
IBIT became the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin ETF fund by increasing its Bitcoin holdings from 2,621 Bitcoin on January 11 to 187,531 Bitcoin by March 7, 2024, an increase of over 7,000%. At the time of writing, IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings were valued at $12.6 billion.
In addition to spot Bitcoin ETF funds, BlackRock is actively working with U.S. regulators on a spot Ethereum ETF fund. In November 2023, BlackRock filed Form S-1 with the Delaware Division of Corporations for the iShares Ethereum Trust. Industry analysts and observers were discussing whether U.S. financial watchdogs would approve the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF fund in 2024. It took over a decade for the SEC to support a spot ETF fund for Bitcoin in the United States.

Crypto Analyst Bluntz Shares Key Observations on Bitcoin and Altcoins,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 13:15:49.296667,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Crypto Analyst Bluntz Shares Key Observations on Bitcoin and Altcoins
Famous crypto analyst and trader Bluntz recently shared his latest observations on primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and two significant altcoins. The analyst posted his observations on his personal account on social media platform X.
Bitcoin’s Optimism Intact: Anticipating a Parabolic Surge
Starting his assessment with Bitcoin, Bluntz mentioned that the largest cryptocurrency is primed for a significant rally once it surpasses the critical resistance level around $69,000. Despite a 14% pullback from its all-time high (around $69,200), the analyst maintains his optimism for Bitcoin’s trajectory, foreseeing a parabolic rise in the short term.
With current data, BTC has quickly recovered after its correction on March 5th, trading at $67,441 with a 0.92% increase over the last 24 hours at the time this article was prepared.
Altcoins on the Analyst’s Watchlist
Following Bitcoin, Bluntz turned his attention to Solana (SOL), the fourth-largest altcoin by market value, predicting an upward movement soon. In his analysis of the SOL/USD trading pair, he noted that SOL has completed four waves of a five-wave upward movement on the daily timeframe, potentially rising towards the $200 level.

Bluntz also emphasized the potential for upward momentum in the SOL/BTC trading pair, indicating that SOL/BTC has completed a three-wave downward formation on the daily timeframe and signaling the potential restart of the main uptrend.

Lastly, the analyst analyzed the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sei (SEI). Bluntz detected a strong reversal at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level for the altcoin, which he mentioned could signal a serious uptrend in the future. Fibonacci retracement levels, considered to represent natural support and resistance levels, provide significant technical insight into potential price movements.

Despite these advances, the industry faces ongoing challenges in maintaining user engagement and retention, with trading volume and transaction metrics lagging behind expectations.Blockchain platforms actively pursue growth opportunities through partnerships with content creators like Web2 gaming studios. Focusing on mutual development between games and platforms, alongside expanding gaming IPs, is central to broadening player engagement and enriching the ecosystem.Data for this report was obtained from Footprint’s GameFi research page. This easy-to-use dashboard, updated in real-time, contains the most vital stats and metrics to understand the Web3 Game industry. Click here to find all the latest about prices, projects, funding rounds, and more.Monthly Market ReviewIn February 2024, Bitcoin and Ether both showcased impressive growth, with Bitcoin surging 46.5% to close at $62,404, crossing $60,000 for the first time since Q4 2021, and nearing its all-time high by just 9%. Ether slightly outpaced Bitcoin, climbing 48.1% to end the month at $3,383.Source: BTC Price & ETH Price — Footprint AnalyticsFebruary’s significant uptick in the cryptocurrency market was influenced by multiple factors. The introduction of new spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. attracted massive inflows, totaling $6 billion in February alone, signaling strong investor confidence and a shift toward cryptocurrency as a viable store of value. Additionally, anticipation of Ethereum’s network upgrade in March and Bitcoin’s halving event in April contributed to the price gains.However, broader market dynamics, such as inflation concerns and Federal Reserve policies, could pose challenges to continued growth. The uptick in inflation in February signals a risk that anticipated interest rate cuts in the U.S. may be delayed until later this year or beyond.Overall Web3 Game MarketRiding the wave of the cryptocurrency surge, the market cap of blockchain game tokens increased by 54.0% throughout the month, to reach a noteworthy $18.5 billion.February continued the upward trend in daily active users (wallets), reaching 2.3 million — a 28.9% increase from January. The endeavors of blockchain game developers and builders have successfully drawn more Web2 studios and gamers into the Web3 gaming era.Source: Blockchain Game Daily Active Users — Footprint AnalyticsHowever, the picture isn’t as rosy for user engagement and retention as it is for acquisition. These areas remain significant challenges for most Web3 game developers, with trading volume and transaction performance lagging, as indicated by data from Footprint Analytics.Source: Blockchain Game Monthly Volume & Transactions- Footprint AnalyticsIn the broader context of the Web3 game market, its growing impact on other blockchain sectors, notably in-game NFTs, has become increasingly apparent.An illustrative case is Gas Hero, developed by StepN’s Find Satoshi Lab. Announced on February 28, the game faced major difficulties, prompting a return to closed beta. Following a successful launch in January, its NFT trading volume suffered an 87.2% downturn to $12.3 million. This steep decline played a pivotal role in dampening NFT trading activity across the Polygon and Mooar, an NFT marketplace, where NFT trading volumes decreased by 80.8% and 87.2%, respectively.Web3 Game ChainsFebruary’s gamer rankings showed Ronin, BNB Chain, and Polygon leading in user activity, with shares of 29.1%, 13.4%, and 13.1%, respectively. Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Ronin topped the charts in trading volume.Source: Active Gamers Shared by Chain- Footprint AnalyticsBlockchain platforms are seizing opportunities for growth through collaboration with content creators. In response to local regulatory challenges, South Korean Web3 game developers actively pursue global markets for their blockchain-based games. A notable development in this context is Oasys, offering both Layer-1 and Ethereum-based Layer-2 networks for game developers. Oasys recently announced strategic partnerships with South Korean game developer Com2uS, and shortly thereafter with South Korean internet giant Kakao’s Web3 gaming division Metabora SG.Expanding the ecosystem through mutual growth between games and blockchain platforms is another strategic approach. Pixels, a Web3 farming game, shifted from Polygon to Ronin in late October 2023, leveraging Ronin’s superior interoperability and marketing support. This move propelled the game’s visibility and on-chain activity, with Pixels registering over 1.5 million on-chain interactions in February, nearing the 1 million user milestone. This growth benefits Ronin, highlighting the mutual advantages of such partnerships.Furthermore, Pixels launched its PIXEL token in February, complemented by play-to-airdrop campaigns and a Binance Launchpool rewards program. Pixels announced a 20 million PIXEL airdrop for those staking Ronin’s RON token, rewarding Ronin’s supporters.Web3 Games OverviewFebruary saw the number of active blockchain games hold steady at 2,880, with the share of games having over 1,000 users declining from 8.3% to 7.9%. Despite a 28.9% rise in active users, the expansion of active games did not mirror this optimism, even amid early signs of a bull market. It seems only a small portion of blockchain games is successfully attracting an expanding player base.Source: Monthly Active Blockchain Games — Footprint AnalyticsSome games are expanding their gaming intellectual property (IP). Bali Games, a South Korea-based mobile game developer, successfully launched Axie Champions, a match-3 RPG on the Ronin blockchain. The game utilizes the popular Axie Infinity IP through a collaboration with Sky Mavis, the developers behind Axie Infinity. Players engaging in the game will be rewarded with the $AXS token.Meanwhile, the introduction of new games continues to energize the market. MATR1X FIRE, a first-person shooter game, launched in February and soon attracted over 400K daily active users. As a platform, MATR1X combines artificial intelligence (AI), Web3, and eSports to create innovative gaming products.Game Investment and FundingIn February, the Web3 gaming sector sustained momentum, securing $83.6 million across 19 funding rounds. This activity underscores the industry’s ongoing allure and the continued confidence of investors in the blockchain gaming arena.Web3 Gaming Industry Funding Rounds In February 2024However, of the 19 funding rounds observed, a notable 89.5% were for amounts under $10 million, indicating a more measured investment strategy.Highlighting the sector’s dynamism, several gaming studios and games such as Brawl Studios (BitBrawl), Matr1x FIRE, and Pixels successfully secured new funding. Additionally, gaming platforms remain a sector of interest, with entities like Crystal Fun, Ultiverse, and OVERWORLD making strides. Notably, OVERWORLD, incubated within the Xterio ecosystem, garnered $10 million in seed funding to pioneer cross-platform multiplayer RPGs.The spotlight also fell on gaming infrastructure, with Ready Games Network (READYgg) and Helika, a Web3 gaming analytics platform, closing their latest rounds of funding.The gambling platform Monkey Tilt secured the largest funding in February, with $21 million from Polychain and others.

THORChain Price Bulls Sustain The Bullish Stance


  RUNEUSD Chart Analysis Source: Tradingview.com
 

The THORChain price has continued to rise and recorded massive gains since mid-October, last year. However, the stance by the bulls faced some rejection at $7.36, allowing the price to trend back through a retrace.
The price movements allowed the price to form a cup and handle pattern, as the bulls continue to show resilience to push the price even higher.
RUNE is trading well above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), a confirmation of the sustained bullish momentum.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also trending upward within the overbought region at 72, which is a signal of investor optimism as they take more buying positions.

Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also bullish, as the moving average line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange), representing a bullish crossover. Investors often use a bullish crossover as a signal to make more buys.
Additionally, the green bars on the histogram are starting to form over the neutral line, which shows that the current momentum is positive. The Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (green) crosses above the trigger line (orange), which is a confirmation of a bullish moving average crossover, indicating an incoming bullish trend.
THORChain Price Prediction
The THORChain price long-term price analysis indicates that the price is currently on a strong bullish trend, as it breaks over the cup and handle pattern. Additionally, the MACD, RSI, and Stochastic Oscillator provide a bullish outlook for optimistic investors.
The 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross at $1.29, which encourages the bulls to rally the price, with the next target set at $8.44, a 16.38% increase from the current price.
However, the RSI and the Stochastic Oscillator indicate that the asset has already entered the overbought levels, suggesting an incoming price correction. In such a scenario, 5.06, coinciding with the 50-day SMA, would act as the next support zone.
As the RUNE price soars, investors are also looking at eTukTuk, a compelling eco-friendly crypto that investors say has what it takes to soar 10X on launch.

AI projects are seemingly being overhyped and under-delivering, raising questions about their long-term credibility. While AI tokens are registering huge profits despite other tokens’ plunges, the long-term implications of these tokens will have to face many technical hurdles and will require more than just decentralizing.
One of the primary hurdles is, that crypto primarily focuses on decentralization while AI  relies on heavily centralized data sources.
Can Hype Lead to Price Corrections?
Despite the negative outlook, many AI tokens have recently outperformed Bitcoin and major stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft. The AI tokens have performed positively even when Bitcoin was trading negatively. This was due to the market sentiment in the broader crypto market and induced AI news Headlines.
When speculators invest in a project based on its hype instead of considering its utility and adoption, such activity may lead to price corrections if the technology cannot meet the hype. Therefore, questions are being raised over the bold claims of crypto platforms over their significant disruptions.
As per a report by David Han, a research analyst at Coinbase, the AI projects will encounter daunting competition and technical hurdles that can significantly affect its progress. He stated that crypto AI products tend to face an uphill battle against the broader market and regulatory forces.
AI Tokens Outperforming!
The total value of AI-based crypto projects has reached a massive $26 billion this year. About 30% of these gains were driven by another rise in Nvidia’s stock, whose shares saw an increase of 15% this week. Nvidia rose 8% to $728.35 from $674.72 in late February. Other AI-associated stock prices, AI-related tokens, and meme-coins increased following its rise.
Tokens like Akash and Render have gained 146% and 99% compared to Bitcoin’s 54%. However, the outlook for AI-based projects cannot be predicted. As of March 8, AI tokens have a market capitalization of $51.18 billion, as per data from Crypto.com.","['AI', 'SIGNA', 'AIC', 'WHEN', 'BUB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eae2ba8ffd0d2db35ff705/
Coinbase Warned Investors Against These Altcoins!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"The upward trend in the cryptocurrency market continues. Although Bitcoin touched its $69,000 ATH and started to decline, the altcoin market remains active.
At this point, especially while artificial intelligence altcoins stand out with their rapid rise, the fact that Nvidia, the world's number one artificial intelligence chip manufacturer, will hold a conference on March 18-21 was effective in the rise of artificial intelligence-themed altcoins.
While this conference of Nvidia increased the interest in the artificial intelligence sector, altcoins such as FET, RNDR, ARKM attracted attention with their rise.

However, Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, warned against the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) tokens.
While Coinbase research analyst David Han argued in his latest report that AI-related tokens may be overhyped in the short to medium term, he said many of the rapid changes in the AI industry should be cautious about the long-term sustainability of the AI token.
Coinbase analyst David Han noted that AI-themed altcoins face tough competition and technical hurdles that could significantly hinder their progress, writing:

“Our view is that the value potential of many AI tokens may be exaggerated as a result of the broad interest in the AI industry and that many AI tokens may lack sustainable demand-side drivers in the short to medium term.
At this point, as Coinbase, we think that the rise in AI tokens is not sustainable due to some obstacles.
“At this point, investors need to be careful with AI tokens.”

"Alt Market Slid Double-Digits During $BTC Dump, But Recovery Is Underway — Here Are 3 Coins to Buy Now While Prices Are Still Low",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"In bull markets, dips are for buying, and the recent liquidation wipe has opened an opportunity to swipe some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy at great prices. As the alt mark slid double-digits amid Bitcoin ($BTC), a recovery is already underway. Yet many coins are still trading at a significant discount – here are 3 coins to buy during the pull-back.Cardano ($ADA) is a top contender for the new retail money bid, Bonk ($BONK) is the leading memecoin on Solana ($SOL), and Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) is lining up to be 2024’s hottest presale. Time to accumulate before the next leg up!Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) Presale Soars Above $4 MillionGalaxy Fox is a must-buy during this period, and this presale has broken above $4 million. Memecoins that made it beyond the $1 million market cap typically run all the way to the hundred million mark, and there is no reason $GFOX will be an exception.Its play-to-earn component makes this protocol a hybrid model. While enjoying the standard high-octane upside of a memecoin, investors now have the opportunity to play and earn. The endless runner pays out prizes at the end of each season and even integrates NFT functionality, with any person holding a Galaxy Fox NFT granted special in-game stats.$GFOX’s tokenomics model is another big selling point. The token burn reduces supply, staking rewards provide another opportunity to earn, and the taxation system allows for two unique mechanisms. First, it directs funding to the Treasury, which drives further growth via marketing, and second, it funds staking payouts. Galaxy Fox funding staking payouts with taxes ensures the supply remains fully deflationary and earning yield on an asset with a declining supply is a blockbuster value proposition.Supported by the GameFi narrative and the rampant appetite for memecoin ownership, $GFOX is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Galaxy Fox is ready to shine, and anticipation continues to build for its retail launch with the presale already 90% sold out.

Cardano ($ADA) DeFi TVL $600 Million Cardano suffered a brutal double-digit drawdown, but this alternative layer one is a top crypto to buy during this pullback. Since the Alonzo upgrade, Cardano has had smart contract functionality, and recently, its DeFi TVL crossed $600 million. No longer a dead chain and with plenty going on in its ecosystem, $ADA has put itself back on the map.The return of retail money to markets from the last cycle will naturally benefit old tokens. Cardano is a classic example. Returning money recognizes the $ADA ticker and will be more inclined to buy. Not to mention the dominant idea of averaging into assets that have fallen in value to reduce the average purchase cost. Retail money likes Cardano, and it is an excellent crypto to load up on before the next upward rally begins. $ADA has already recovered most of its losses from the dip, but it’s still trading at a discount.


Bonk ($BONK) Solana’s Leading Memecoin 
Bonk is an easy play. Memecoins have solidified themselves as a genuine vertical this cycle, and new investors want to make money fast. There is nothing wrong with this. While some criticize memecoins for lack of fundamentals and vaporware valuation, they forget that speculation is a use case in and of itself.Many of the top cryptos to buy right now are memecoins, and $BONK, as an established market leader, is a great choice. Solana will become an obvious onramp for newer investors, and $BONK will be an obvious beneficiary. $BONK remains down approximately 20% since the correction, representing a great buying opportunity.Closing Thoughts: Dips Are For Buying 
In a bull market, dips are for buying, and double-digit drawdowns are a blessing. Investors should be deploying any spare stablecoin they have on hand during these liquidation days. The long-term upward trend is only getting started.Galaxy Fox is the top choice among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now because it is still in its presale. Imagine buying $BONK early in 2023. That is where $GFOX is now. If you move fast, you can still join the presale today before the retail launch!

3 Altcoins That Will Outperform Ethereum (ETH) In 2024,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"Trends come and go with lightning speed in the world of cryptocurrency investment. While Ethereum has long been a cornerstone of the digital asset market, newer altcoins are emerging with the potential to outpace it in terms of growth and innovation. In this article, we will delve into three such altcoins – Pepe (PEPE), Retik Finance (RETIK), and Dogwifhat (WIF) – that are poised to outperform Ethereum in 2024.
Pepe (PEPE): Riding the Bullish Wave of Meme Culture
Pepe, named after the iconic internet meme “Feels Good Man” frog, burst onto the cryptocurrency scene in April 2023 and has since experienced a meteoric rise. Within just 27 days, Pepe saw a staggering 337% surge, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. What distinguishes Pepe is not only its rapid ascent but also its unique backstory and robust tokenomics. With a total circulating supply of 420 trillion tokens, Pepe stands out in the crowded altcoin market. What’s particularly noteworthy is that over 90% of these tokens are securely locked in liquidity pools, ensuring stability and mitigating the risk of volatility. This strategic approach to token distribution enhances investor confidence and contributes to Pepe’s overall appeal.As meme culture continues to exert influence on the digital asset landscape, Pepe finds itself well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. With its strong fundamentals and growing community support, Pepe has the potential to outperform even established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum in 2024. As investors seek opportunities in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Pepe stands as a compelling option with promising prospects for growth and long-term viability.

Retik Finance (RETIK): The Rising Star of DeFi
Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a formidable contender challenging Ethereum’s dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. In 2024, Retik Finance experienced a remarkable surge of 410%, vastly outperforming Ethereum’s more modest 52% growth. While Ethereum has shown signs of stagnation according to some experts, Retik Finance’s youthful energy and innovative approach to DeFi have captured the imagination of investors.A significant strength of Retik Finance (RETIK) lies in its impressive presale, which raised over $32 million in funds. This substantial backing demonstrates investor confidence in the project’s potential to disrupt the cryptocurrency market and carve out its niche in the DeFi landscape. As Retik Finance prepares for its listing in the coming days, anticipation is at a fever pitch. Experts project a staggering 10,200% pump in 2024 to outperform Ethereum, signalling the potential for exponential growth and significant returns for early investors. With its robust fundamentals, strong community support, and ambitious roadmap, Retik Finance is poised to make waves in the cryptocurrency market. As investors seek out innovative projects with the potential for substantial gains, Retik Finance stands out as a compelling option with promising prospects for the future.
Dogwifhat (WIF): From Meme to Mainstream
Dogwifhat, a memecoin that stormed onto the scene in December 2023, has rapidly asserted itself as a formidable presence in the cryptocurrency market. Within a short span, its value surged to $0.53, driven by an astonishing 700% increase between January 8 and January 18. Endorsements from industry giants like Binance and BitMEX further propelled its ascent, solidifying its position as a significant player in the digital asset space. Despite market fluctuations, Dogwifhat has demonstrated resilience, currently valued at $1.69. As it continues to garner momentum and visibility, Dogwifhat stands poised to potentially outperform Ethereum in 2024. Leveraging the power of meme culture and strategic partnerships, Dogwifhat is primed for further growth and could emerge as a standout performer in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.Investors eyeing opportunities in the market are increasingly turning their attention to Dogwifhat as it establishes itself as a promising asset with considerable upside potential.
Conclusion
As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, new altcoins are emerging as formidable competitors to established players like Ethereum. Pepe, Retik Finance, and Dogwifhat represent just a few of the many projects poised to outshine Ethereum in 2024. With innovative tokenomics, strong community support, and a finger on the pulse of emerging trends, these altcoins are well-positioned to carve out their niche in the digital asset market. Investors would do well to keep a close eye on these promising projects as they navigate the exciting and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.

Floki Leads the Memecoin Bull Rally With Impressive Gains,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"
Floki (FLOKI) has surged 212% in the past 7 days.
Bullish momentum with 9D EMA at $$0.00012451 and RSI at 81.

Floki Inu (FLOKI) has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, marking a remarkable 212% increase in its price over the past week. This spike has propelled the meme coin to a three-year high of $0.000174. Currently, trading at $0.0001704, alongside a trading volume jump to $710 million, up by 35.36%. Currently, Floki Inu boasts a market capitalization of $1 billion, ranking it as the 68th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.



   FLOKI Price Chart, Source: TradingView
  


This significant uptrend is part of a broader bullish movement for Floki Inu, which has seen its value soar by over 202% in the past month. Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to a series of strategic milestones within the ecosystem, particularly its achievement of surpassing $366 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) across its various platforms. This development underscores the coin’s growing utility and resilience beyond its origins as a memecoin.

Meanwhile, FlokiFi Locker contributes another impressive $127 million to the total. In a bold move to further enhance the token’s value and network security, Floki developers have proposed a significant burn of 2% of the circulating supply, estimated to be valued at over $11 million.
This strategic decision not only aims to increase the token’s scarcity but also reflects Floki’s commitment to maintaining a robust and secure ecosystem. With these milestones, It is making strides toward cementing its legitimacy and appeal in the broader crypto landscape, potentially setting the stage for further adoption and price gains.
Moreover, market analysts speculate that if the current bullish trend continues, it could potentially eliminate an additional zero from its price, signaling even greater investor confidence and market strength.","['RLY', 'MEME', 'FLOKI', 'MEM', 'GAINS']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eae17ecc420711a6230e61/
"This DeFi Token Is Completely Outperforming BONK, SHIB, and FLOKI As Meme Mania Continues",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"The crypto market cap is close to the $3T valuation, with more projects springing up daily. Many investors are on the lookout for tokens that will guarantee short and long-term profits. 
Bonk (BONK), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and FLOKI (FLOKI) have witnessed massive rallies in the past few days, with analysts picking them as the best meme coins to buy now. Meanwhile, Pullix (PLX) is making waves in the market after witnessing massive trading activity upon listing on Uniswap. 
Pullix (PLX) Price Surges to $0.55 From a Floor Price of $0.168
Even though Bonk, Shiba Inu, and FLOKI are on an impressive rally, analysts are still optimistic about the potential of Pullix (PLX) and pick it as one of the best DeFi cryptos to buy now. A 300% ROI has been received by early investors who bought the PLX on launch, with more returns coming up.
The Pullix platform aims to resolve all bottlenecks associated with DeFi and CeFi exchanges. Pullix plans to achieve this by offering high liquidity, zero transaction fees, and fast transaction processing. The platform also promises superb security to protect investors’ digital assets. The tokens liquidity pool has been locked for 2 years in Uniswap to build trust and ensure stability.
The Pullix token which was listed on Uniswap at a set price of $0.168 now trades for $0.70, barely 2 days after listing. By tomorrow, BitMart CEX will list the token. Notably, XT.COM, a popular crypto exchange, has listed the PLX under its innovation zone and under the PLX/USDT trading pair.
Zooming in, the PLX key market indicators are surging. The market cap has increased from $33.6M to more than $140M with the token targeting the $500M mark. At the current trajectory, some analysts have projected an 800% rally in the year. Meanwhile, token holders can also earn more through the Pullix profit sharing model in which token holders will be given a percentage of the Pullix daily revenue.
Bonk (BONK) Value Tripled As Price Surge
The BONK price chart has shown a strong upward movement in recent times. The Solana-based meme coin price has increased by 215% in the past month and 95% in the past week, based on data from CoinMarketCap.
The BONK trading volume has been declining in the past few days as the meme coin market loses bullish steam. Despite the decline, some analysts still think the BONK token will witness a resurgence soon. They base their prediction on the fact that meme coins thrive on hype. The more FUD, the higher the chances of the meme coin market booming. Based on its market stats, BONK is one of the best meme coins to buy now.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Value Surges by 60%
The Shiba Inu token, an Ethereum-based meme coin, is one of the top meme coins to watch out for in the crypto market. This is based on its market stats which show a massive 287% rise on its monthly price chart. Shiba Inu price has also gained 198% in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.
Despite its positive price surge, the Shiba Inu trading volume is declining which shows decreasing trading activity. Some analysts think the declining market activity could hinder the ongoing rally.
FLOKI (FLOKI) Makes 4x Gain Due to Token Burn Proposal
The FLOKI token price surged after the proposal to burn 2% of the meme coin supply was approved by the community. For context, market stats show that the FLOKI price has gained 400% in the past month and 139% in the last week. There are conflicting signals on the FLOKI key market indicators.
The FLOKI trading volume is declining. However, the market cap is increasing. Analysts believe that as long as the meme coin market continues to boom, the FLOKI token price will continue to rise.

Tesla’s surprise Bitcoin boost sparks speculation and future market impacts,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Optimisus,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"Tesla's Bitcoin holdings have seen a significant increase, with Arkham Intelligence revealing a total of 11,509 BTC, surpassing the amount disclosed in their last earnings call.  
Tesla has also made a fresh purchase of $5.94 million worth of Bitcoin, further fueling speculation and interest in their cryptocurrency strategy.  
In February 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and briefly accepted it as a payment method for their electric cars.  
However, the venture was short-lived as the company sold about 10% of its holdings in March 2021 and offloaded 75% of its Bitcoin stash in the second quarter of 2022 due to environmental concerns.  
The recent uptick in Tesla's Bitcoin holdings and recent acquisition have sparked widespread speculation on social media, with observers pondering whether Tesla is rekindling its Bitcoin acquisition strategy or if the recent increase might be attributed to an accounting error.  
There is growing anticipation for a potential announcement regarding new Bitcoin purchases in Tesla's upcoming earnings report, though there has yet to be any official statement from Tesla or Musk on the matter.  
These developments highlight the dynamic and complex relationship between Tesla and the cryptocurrency market, with Musk's fluctuating views on Bitcoin contributing to the evolving narrative.  
With the addition of today's Bitcoin purchase, Tesla continues to play a pivotal role in the ongoing discourse around corporate engagement with digital currencies.

Unlocking The Future of Blockchain Development – Morpheus Labs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Altcoin Buzz,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"Many Web2 projects are starting their journey into Web3. But that’s easier said than done. There are quite a few differences between the two of them. 
For example, a big difference is the decentralized character of Web3. Creators have much more say over their work. We, as users, will also have more control over what personal information we want to share. So, switching from Web2 to Web3 has plenty of differences and challenges. Still, more and more Web2 firms are ready to make the transition. 
It takes good planning, coordination, and knowledge of the Web3 space. All this, and more, is precisely what Morpheus Labs offers. They make the transition from Web2 to Web3 easy for companies. Let’s see how they do it.
What Is Morpheus Labs?
Morpheus Labs has all the tools for a smooth transition from Web2 to Web3. The platform also uses AI to optimize its performance and service. Some of these tools are, for instance:

Low-code — There’s no need to know advanced coding. 
Multichain — Morpheus Labs offers its services on various chains.
Automation — AI-powered workflow studio
AI-Powered smart contract Studio.
Collaborative Development Environment (CDE) — A collaborative environment that enables multiple individuals or teams to work together on a project.

This helps streamline the development process. It also increases the efficiency of Web3 development. Furthermore, it allows external developers to contribute from any part of the world. 

Template solutions — Pre-built templates for Web3 Dapps. 


 Unlocking the Future of Blockchain Development: Introducing Smart Contract Studio (#SCS) and #Web3 Workflow Studio
In the ever-evolving landscape of #blockchain technology, the demand for innovative solutions to streamline #development processes has never been greater

— Morpheus Labs (@morpheuslabs_io) February 29, 2024


Morpheus Labs already works in various crypto sectors. For example:

The Metaverse — With JPGames. This suits the hospitality and gaming spaces.
Gamification — with Tencent. For gaming, education, or e-learning, 
NFT-enabled solutions — with Huawei Cloud. For RWA like property or ticketing agencies.
E-commerce — with Alibaba Cloud. For fashion or food and beverage industries.
Digital assets — with Ant Group. Finance, banks, real estate, gaming.
Education in Web3 — with Phillip Capital. For hackathons, workshops, or educational firms.

So, it shows the versatility that Morpheus Labs offers. Their tools and solutions fit into various industries and verticals. However, don’t let their name fool you. Yes, they have ‘Labs’ in their name, but they’re not an incubator. Nonetheless, the team does work together with incubators, and they can secure grants.
How Does Morpheus Labs Work?
Rest assured; Morpheus Labs doesn’t work in mysterious ways. So, to give you a better understanding of what they offer, think of this.  Let’s take a look at other low-code platforms. They’re easy to find. For instance, you may be familiar with:

Bubble. 
Softr.
Webflow. 
WordPress.
Wix.


They all offer an app or website building. However, they’re all Web2 platforms. Give or take, they all work similarly. You may have your favorite among them. So, what they offer is building blocks allowing you to build a website and add content. You can also add other elements, to mix and match what you want included in the front or back end.
But here’s the kicker, there’s no Web3 alternative for them. That’s even though everything Web3 is digitally native. So, that’s where Morpheus Labs offers tools that work in a Web3 environment. The same situation arises if I look at automation. Take, for example, Zapier, Make, n8n, and others. They all connect web apps and services. All automated. But again, why is there no Web3 alternative? That’s where Morpheus Labs has an edge. It offers a suite of tools that fill this gap. For example, with ML SEED. That’s a Blockchain-Platform-as-a-Service. 
It allows you to build your blockchain with everything you need around it. Or how about Morpheus Labs being the potential Web3 version of Zapier? Here are some of the features Morpheus Labs offers. These make for a smooth Web3 transition and integration:

Coin creation.
Smart contracts.
Audits.
Introduction to CoinGecko.
Websites.

All this it offers in an easy-to-use environment, remember the low code? It’s an all-in-one automated convenience, powered by AI. It’s like an out-of-the-box approach. Ready to use, and easy to deploy. Develop, test, deploy, run, and scale it. All are conveniently located in one single console. 

Everyone in Web2 is eyeing the Web3 space. Morpheus Labs makes that transition possible. It clearly shows the potential that Morpheus Labs has.
Upcoming Events
Morpheus Labs has a couple of events coming up. Let’s take a look at these. For instance:

An Ambassador program — Expect this around mid to late March. More details will follow soon.
There will be a live event on 15th March in Singapore. The Next Frontier: Unlocking Digital Potential with AI, Web3, and Collaborative Innovation. The event is at the Sofitel in Singapore.  It’s dedicated to exploring the intersection of AI, Web3, and collaborative innovation. Its focus is on: “Unlocking digital potential and driving forward-thinking solutions in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.”

On KuCoin a trading event just finished. You could earn a slice of the $10,000 in $MIND. There’s no need to worry, though, this is a recurring event. So you’ll get another chance. Speaking of the $MIND token, let’s take a closer look at this.

The $MIND Token
At first, it went by the name of $MITX. However, the team increased its services and the new $MIND token is multi-layered. The current $MIND price is $0.006351 with a market cap of $6.6 million. There’s a max and total supply of 2.1 billion $MIND. Out of these, 1.05 billion $MIND tokens circulate. 
As you can see, a small and interesting market cap. Over the last 30 days, the token is up by 164%. So, besides KuCoin, $MIND is also listed at MEXC and Quickswap. What do you think of the transition from Web2 to Web3? Let me know in the comments how you see that.

$PEEN Emerges as the Latest Trending Meme Coin Sensation: Is it the Next Shiba Inu?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"Peen token caught the eye of many crypto enthusiasts after its fair launch on Uniswap because it brings something totally unusual to the crypto world. In just the first hour of trading, the price jumped from $0.000621 to a staggering $0.0034!
But, apart from its huge growth potential, what sets $PEEN apart is its adult-themed humor. Literally, the first thing that pops up when you open their official website is “Ready for PEEN-etration.”
All jokes aside, this new trending meme coin is ready to take over the crypto market, and some analysts are already calling it the next Shiba Inu.
Let’s review all the facts and see what this new meme coin is about!
>>>Buy Peen Coin Now<<<
$PEEN Trending NSFW Coin Aiming to Hit $100m Market Cap
This project revolves around an unapologetic meme coin, drawing inspiration from everyone’s inner teenager.
The project’s primary aim is straightforward: infuse crude humor to maintain $PEEN as a hot topic on social media and safeguard its value.
However, the vision extends further. It aims to utilize its intriguing imagery for rapid price increases, aspiring to become the leading meme coin of 2024 and establishing itself as the “baddest” and “hardest” in the market.
The Peen token, known for its straightforward approach, is now launching daily on Uniswap. Everything about this project, including its total supply of 800,813,569 tokens, is infused with adult humor, appealing to those who enjoy a good laugh.




$PEEN’s roadmap, dubbed “PEENMAP,” outlines aggressive marketing strategies with the ambitious goal of reaching a $100 million market cap.
The token enters a welcoming market in the first stage, showcasing its crude humor to the fullest. Excitement mounts as the token gains traction in the market over time. Specific imagery highlights $PEEN’s first significant price increase, marking the beginning of its initial marketing push.
$PEEN debuted at $0.00062436 with an initial cap of $500,000. But, the meme coin has witnessed an incredible 559% increase in less than an hour upon debuting, soaring from $0.000621 to $0.00347.
This surge has propelled Peen token’s market cap close to $1.5 million, with trading volumes exceeding $4 million.
Although the token has experienced a corrective phase since its peak, enthusiasts are actively striving to boost its value.
While still smaller than established meme coin giants, PEEN’s early momentum is undeniable. It reminds us of the explosive growth seen in coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.

Peen Coin ($PEEN) the Next Big Meme Coin Looking to Match and Overcome Shiba Inu’s Success
Upon visiting the official website, you’ll encounter a frog, quite excited, proudly hoisting the $PEEN flag on the moon, a scene that perfectly captures the project’s tone. As you scroll down, you’ll find a quirky indicator sketch that maintains the same humorous vibe.
The site is decorated with doodles featuring various forms of phallic imagery. This unapologetic humor may evoke nostalgia, reminding us of the internet’s early days, free from political correctness.
Few tokens exhibit such boldness in their humor, and given the current market excitement, many adventurous investors might find $PEEN intriguing.
On the other hand, tokens such as Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) have followed a familiar pattern, soaring in value purely due to hype.
Despite lacking real-world utility, these coins gained traction thanks to their enthusiastic online communities. Now, $PEEN seems poised to ride this wave of excitement, but with a playful adult twist.
Can $PEEN really match the impressive returns of tokens like Shiba Inu? And is there a chance for $PEEN to be listed on major centralized exchanges (CEXs)?
The potential gains are evident, with numerous investors gaining life-changing profits from early investments in Shiba Inu. However, achieving similar success comes with its own set of challenges.
The meme coin market is highly competitive, and tokens like Shiba Inu benefited from unique circumstances that drove their popularity. For $PEEN to reach similar heights, it must maintain its initial momentum, foster its community, and capitalize on the optimistic sentiment in the crypto market.
>>>Buy Peen Coin Now<<<




Yet, $PEEN stands out as a distinctive meme coin in the current landscape. This presents an opportunity for it to capture attention before other adult-themed tokens emerge.
If $PEEN can navigate these challenges effectively, the possibility of CEX listings and significant growth will be in the palm of their hand!
>>>Buy Peen Coin Now<<<
The Final Words
Already overcoming all expectations, Peen token is on a steady path to becoming the next big meme coin, possibly even beating Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.
After an explosive DEX launch, the prices jumped an astonishing 335% mimicking the early success of Shiba Inu.
Therefore, if $PEEN stays on the same path early investors could see some huge profits in the plus 500 range in the near future!
Captivate on the early buzz and acquire $PEEN while it’s only $0.0008474 before the price skyrockets and this becomes another BTC story!

"Crypto-AI sector could fail to grow if the industry not follow this, Analyst warn",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"In the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as one of the industries experiencing continuous surges in popularity. Following the trend in the AI sector within the Web3 landscape, cryptocurrencies associated with AI are also attracting significant attention from both investors and traders. In light of this, Coinbase research analyst David Han has expressed caution and published a report that may impact the prices of these AI tokens. Will the AI industry fail to grow? 
In a recent report,research analyst Han expresses concern about the long-term sustainability of AI tokens due to the rapid changes in AI technology. According to the report, the main challenge lies in the fact that while crypto projects and industries aim for decentralization, most AI projects still heavily rely on centralized components and data sources. This dual nature could pause the growth of crypto-AI projects and discourage investor interest. 
Addressing these drawbacks, Han suggests two opportunities for improvement. These suggestions include enhancing blockchain data for human-readable transactions and analysis and working towards decentralizing the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. Additionally, Han highlights that a decentralized AI future, as visualized by the crypto industry, is not guaranteed, and the overall future of the AI industry remains uncertain. Analyst suggestions regarding the AI limitations 
Despite these limitations and suggestions by the research analyst, it is observed that in the past few days, AI tokens have outperformed top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others. Furthermore, these AI tokens have also surpassed top stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Crypto-AI tokens and price-performance analysis 
Han believes that the crypto-AI industry still has the potential to grow even stronger, highlighting the need to decentralize AI components. Analysts state, “A decentralized AI future, as currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed – in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.”
Despite these challenges, the crypto-AI industry has experienced a massive surge of over 7.8% in its market capitalization, and the trading volume of these AI tokens has also increased by 23%. The top AI tokens that have gained immense popularity and experienced a significant price surge in the last 30 days include Render (RNDR), The Graph (GRT), Theta Network (THETA), Fetch.ai (FET), and SingularityNET (AGIX).

Binance Labs Fuels Seven Innovative Startups in Recent Investment Drive,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Binance Labs Fuels Seven Innovative Startups in Recent Investment Drive
Binance Labs, the venture arm of the crypto exchange giant Binance, has concluded its sixth investment season, backing seven emerging startups. The initiative is driven by a commitment to foster innovation within the cryptocurrency sphere. The exact investment figures for these startups remain undisclosed, but this move signals Binance Labs’ ongoing support for promising ventures in the decentralized landscape.
Selection of Diverse Crypto Startups
Among the startups receiving investments are Ethena Labs, specializing in synthetic dollar protocols, and Derivio, a decentralized futures exchange built on zkSync technology. Shogun, a DeFi protocol designed to optimize investor value, UXUY for decentralized exchange trading, Cellula in blockchain gaming, NFPrompt integrating AI with Web3 for content creation, and QnA3 for Web3 knowledge sharing, have also been selected. This diverse portfolio underscores Binance Labs’ strategic approach towards various sectors within the blockchain ecosystem.
The sixth season saw a reduction from the initial twelve contenders to the seven that received funding. A Binance Labs representative emphasized the company’s selective investment strategy, aimed at empowering founders with a clear vision, rather than providing universal funding.
In comparison, the fifth season of the investment program had chosen five startups out of twelve for funding, demonstrating Binance Labs’ consistent and critical evaluation for each season’s participants.
Preparations for the Next Investment Wave
With the seventh season on the horizon, Binance Labs is actively seeking innovative founders of early-stage projects to join their upcoming investment wave. The firm maintains an open application process, encouraging a continuous stream of potential candidates. The sixth season attracted hundreds of applications, out of which only a select 3% made it to the final investment round.
Binance Labs continues to expand its investment footprint, with recent support extended to Bitcoin and Ethereum staking protocols. Despite returning unused capital from a previous 500 million dollar fund, Binance Labs remains a pivotal player in nurturing the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem through strategic investments.

Unlocking Data Security: The Power of Tokenization,COIN_MARKET_CAP,UNS Token,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"IntroductionIn today's digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive data is paramount. Enter data tokenization—a cutting-edge process revolutionizing data security and privacy across industries. Let's delve into what data tokenization entails, its significance, how it's transforming the way we protect and manage valuable information, and explore additional applications and considerations.What is Data Tokenization?Data tokenization is the innovative practice of converting sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal health records, into tokens—unique, non-sensitive identifiers. These tokens act as stand-ins for the original data, ensuring secure transfer, storage, and processing without compromising confidentiality.Understanding TokensTokens, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are digital units residing on blockchains. They come in various forms and serve diverse purposes, from encoding data to representing currencies. Popular token standards include ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and BEP-20, issued on blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain.How Data Tokenization WorksImagine switching between social media platforms seamlessly, without the hassle of recreating profiles or risking data exposure. Data tokenization makes this a reality. By linking existing digital identities to new platforms, users can effortlessly transfer personal data while retaining control and privacy.Key Differences: Tokenization vs. EncryptionWhile both tokenization and encryption aim to protect data, they operate differently. Encryption scrambles data into unreadable formats using secret keys, while tokenization replaces sensitive data with unique tokens. Unlike encryption, tokenization doesn't rely on secret keys for data protection.Benefits of Data TokenizationEnhanced Data Security: Tokenization reduces the risk of data breaches and fraud by replacing sensitive information with tokens.Regulatory Compliance: Tokenization aids in meeting stringent data protection regulations by securing sensitive data.Secure Data Sharing: Tokenization enables secure data sharing while preserving confidentiality and privacy.Challenges and ConsiderationsWhile data tokenization offers significant advantages, it's not without its challenges:Data Quality: Tokenization may impact data accuracy and completeness.Data Governance: Legal and ethical questions arise regarding data ownership and usage rights.Data Interoperability: Tokenization can hinder interoperability between systems processing tokenized data.Use Case: Social Media and NFTsTokenization's impact extends beyond traditional data security realms. In social media and NFTs, users can tokenize their data, granting them control over who accesses their content and how it's monetized. This empowers users to safeguard their online presence and maximize the value of their digital assets.Additional Applications of Data TokenizationBeyond social media and NFTs, data tokenization finds applications in various industries:Healthcare: Protecting patient data while enabling secure sharing between healthcare providers.Finance: Securing payment information and facilitating secure transactions.Supply Chain Management: Protecting sensitive supply chain data while ensuring transparency and traceability.Closing ThoughtsData tokenization is rapidly gaining traction across various sectors, driven by the imperative for robust data security and compliance. However, effective implementation necessitates careful planning and adherence to regulatory standards, ensuring data protection while respecting user rights and privacy expectations. As industries continue to embrace this transformative approach, the future of data security looks brighter than ever.",['UNS'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eadea98ffd0d2db35ff6f8/
BlackRock seeks SEC approval for Bitcoin ETF inclusion in Global Allocation Fund,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"BlackRock, a global leader in asset management, is in the process of seeking regulatory approval to incorporate spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its Global Allocation Fund, known as MALOX.
The firm updated its filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 7, outlining its intention to invest in physically-backed Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), including its own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and those offered by other issuers. The move indicates BlackRock’s interest in enabling its fund to invest directly in Bitcoin through national securities exchanges.
The BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, established in 1989, aims to generate investment returns by managing a diversified portfolio consisting of equity, debt, and money market securities from both U.S. and international markets. High-profile companies such as Microsoft and Apple are among those included in the fund’s investments. As of the latest update, MALOX has managed assets totaling $17.8 billion.
This development is part of BlackRock’s broader strategy to engage with digital assets. The firm also updated its filing for the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX) on March 4, indicating a similar interest in incorporating spot Bitcoin ETFs into its investment strategy. BSIIX, with assets under management (AUM) of $36.7 billion, surpasses MALOX in size but has experienced modest gains this year.

The potential inclusion of Bitcoin ETPs in these funds reflects a significant shift in the investment landscape, suggesting a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies among major institutional investors. MacroScope, a crypto analysis platform, commented on the filing, noting the expected increase in such moves by Wall Street firms in the upcoming months, signaling a potential rise in demand and adoption of cryptocurrencies.



A new filing by BlackRock late this afternoon. As I've been saying, you're going to see a lot of this in coming months from Wall Street firms for their in-house investment funds. As filed today by the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund:""The Fund may acquire shares in…— MacroScope (@MacroScope17) March 7, 2024




Despite the proactive steps taken by BlackRock, the SEC’s approval of these filings is still pending. The commission, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has yet to greenlight BlackRock’s proposals to incorporate Bitcoin ETPs into its investment offerings. Nonetheless, BlackRock’s initiative is viewed as a positive development for the cryptocurrency sector, potentially encouraging other asset managers to consider Bitcoin as a component of their investment portfolios.
In addition to exploring Bitcoin ETPs, BlackRock has launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which commenced trading on January 11. Since its debut, IBIT has seen a remarkable increase in its Bitcoin holdings, growing more than 7,000% to 187,531 BTC by March 7, 2024, equivalent to approximately $12.6 billion. This rapid growth positions IBIT as the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.
Furthermore, BlackRock has shown interest in expanding its cryptocurrency portfolio beyond Bitcoin. In November 2023, the company filed an application for a spot Ether ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, with Delaware’s Division of Corporations. The outcome of this application, alongside the broader acceptance of cryptocurrency ETFs by U.S. regulators, remains a closely watched development within the financial and cryptocurrency communities.

"Past bull runs hint at Bitcoin’s potential leap into unprecedented territory, analysts say",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"Expectations are mounting for Bitcoin to potentially surge into six-figure territory, following a dramatic increase of over 57% in its price since the start of the year. 
The recent surge has led to comparisons with the 2021 bull run, during which Bitcoin’s value tripled in three months after breaking its previous high. Analysts maintain a cautious optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future, with some predictions pointing towards a potential rise into six-figure territory. This outlook is partly based on Bitcoin’s performance during past bull runs and significant price increases following similar trends in 2012 and 2016.
The recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has introduced a period of volatility, succeeded by a stable uptrend. This movement allowed Bitcoin to surpass its previous November 2021 high. With the next Bitcoin halving event scheduled for the upcoming month, analysts draw parallels with previous cycles where halvings led to substantial price increases, supporting the bullish sentiment.
The anticipation around the halving event has led to speculation that Bitcoin could exceed $200,000 by June, pushing its total market capitalization beyond $4 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is advancing, with a week-long trend of higher highs.

Notably, large Bitcoin investors, or “whales,” are accumulating Bitcoin at a rate contrary to historical trends. Even as the price nears the all-time high of $69,000, whales have added approximately 4,177 BTC to their holdings, valued at about $279 million. This trend diverges from the usual pattern of whales buying at low prices and selling at high, hinting at their expectation for Bitcoin to trade beyond its previous peak.
As stated earlier, the enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin has been partly fueled by the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Since their debut on Jan. 11, these ETFs have attracted $7.9 billion in inflows, indicating significant market interest.
The optimism has also been echoed by major names in the cryptocurrency space. Robert Kiyosaki, a well-known financial author, has publicly supported Bitcoin’s potential, predicting a rise to $300,000 by year’s end. In a statement on X, Kiyosaki encouraged followers to seize the current momentum, emphasizing the risk of procrastination.
Amidst this backdrop, the automotive giant Tesla is seemingly intensifying its Bitcoin investments. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, an analysis tracking Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet demonstrates a notable increase in the company’s holdings. The wallet now contains 11,509 BTC, a significant rise from the 9,720 BTC reported in Tesla’s previous earnings announcement. This action indicates Tesla’s expanded involvement in the cryptocurrency market.

"Dencun upgrade to further reduce Ethereum’s dominance and accelerate layer-2 solutions, Flipside says",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"With most smart contracts no longer deployed on Ethereum, analysts expect the Dencun upgrade to further boost this trend as layer-2 solutions improve.
Ethereum is quickly losing its status as the top hub for deploying smart contracts amid growing competition among layer-2 networks (l2), analysts at Flipside revealed in a recent research report. According to their data, nearly 640 million smart contracts have been deployed since January 2022, with Polygon and BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain) leading in contract deployments.


  Smart contracts deployed by chain | Source: Flipside
 

Moreover, Flipside says Optimism, a layer-2 solution which operates on top of Ethereum’s architecture, has accounted “for two thirds of total EVM smart contract deployments so far in 2024.”

“As the majority of EVM contracts are no longer deployed directly on Ethereum, we expect the forthcoming Dencun upgrade to further accelerate this trend as L2 solutions become more accessible and efficient.”
Flipside

Analysts noted that contract deployers have also surged, making up 34.7% of categorizable deployers across observed chains since Jan 1, marking a significant increase from 11.2% in both 2022 and 2023. However, Flipside pointed out that it “isn’t just developers that can deploy contracts,” adding that smart contracts can also deploy contracts.

“For instance, ‘Factories’ like UniswapV2Factory allow anyone to create liquidity pools for their tokens permissionlessly. This tends to lead to deployments consolidating around deployers like these.”
Flipside

In the meantime, deployers related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) saw a decline from 18.6% to 8.2% over the same period, analysts said, suggesting that the next bull run “might prioritize decentralized finance over NFTs, which dominated the previous cycle.”
In January, Michael Novogratz’s crypto bank Galaxy Digital said in a research report that 2024 will be a crucial year for Ethereum, as other layer-1 blockchains such as Solana will likely raise the stakes.
Galaxy Digital analysts note that Ethereum’s modular architecture, particularly various rollup types, will introduce new challenges and technological risks due to their early stage of development. Singling out Solana as the most distinctive general-purpose blockchain embracing a monolithic architecture, they position it as the primary competitor against Ethereum.

29K Bitcoin Options Expire Today: What Could Happen?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CO NEWS,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"
Bitcoin (BTC) price continued to demonstrate strong performance, maintaining a 10% gain throughout last week amid high market volatility.
As the crypto market prepares for a significant event, option data reveals upcoming expiration dates that will shape market dynamics.
On-chain data indicates that despite the current volatility, Bitcoin whales and sharks continue to accumulate.

As 29,000 Bitcoin options expire today, opinions on how it might impact the Bitcoin price are drawing attention: Here are the latest details!
What Do Bitcoin Option Data Suggest?

Bitcoin (BTC) price continued to demonstrate strong performance, maintaining a 10% gain throughout last week amid high market volatility. Today, during noon hours, the BTC price rallied above $68,000, but has since partially retraced and is currently at $67,195, with a market cap of $1.32 trillion.
As the crypto market prepares for a significant event, option data reveals upcoming expiration dates that will shape market dynamics. A total of 29,000 BTC options are set to expire, accompanied by a Put-Call Ratio of 0.86, indicating mixed sentiments towards both downside and upside. The maximum pain point is calculated to be $60,000, reflecting a critical price level where the highest number of option contracts become worthless, surpassing a notional value of over $2 billion.
In this anticipatory environment, market volatility has reached nearly a year’s highest level. Bitcoin’s optimistic journey briefly surpassed $69,000, forming a new all-time high, but subsequently experienced a sharp drop of over 10%. Significantly, it’s observed that all major implied volatilities (IVs) have increased, with short-term IVs rising up to 100%, according to reports from Greeks.Live.
Excitement in the US dollar-centric spot bull market has attracted global interest in Bitcoin, recognizing it as a promising store of value in the future. Consequently, there has been an increase in options trading volume and positions. Options are increasingly preferred due to their flexibility, offering hedging for spot buyers and high-leverage opportunities for long and short positions.
On-chain data indicates that despite the current volatility, Bitcoin whales and sharks continue to accumulate. According to on-chain data provider Santiment, despite the market turmoil following the highest volatility of all time, sharks and whales continue to remain active. However, there is a decrease in non-zero $BTC wallets in general, often attributed to small traders giving up. This combination is generally considered bearish.
SEC Delays Options Trading for BTC ETFs
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed the decision on allowing options trading for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF until April 24. Earlier, the SEC sought public opinion on whether Nasdaq should allow options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. In another development, BlackRock has applied to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs for its Global Allocation Fund.
Additionally, the SEC has delayed decisions on spot Bitcoin ETF options for Cboe Exchange, Inc. and Miax Pearl LLC. In its application, the SEC stated:

“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the comments received.”

Thursday’s filings revealed that the SEC has delayed its decision on whether to allow Cboe Exchange, Inc. and Miax Pearl LLC to trade options on spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Massive Missed Profit
Based on the information provided by Lookonchain, the WIF developer had initially sold 350 million WIF tokens for around $29,000 worth of SOL tokens. However, those 350 million WIF tokens are now worth a staggering $693 million, meaning the developer missed out on a potential profit of approximately $653,000,000 by selling too early.


While the developer still holds some WIF tokens worth around $1.17 million, the missed opportunity to earn over $653 million serves as a cautionary tale for traders and developers alike, highlighting the importance of timing and market analysis in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and meme coins.

Volatility still seems prevalent in the digital currency ecosystem, but Bitcoin (BTC) has demonstrated resilience so far, bouncing back to the $68,000 level.
According to predictions by IntoTheBlock, nearly 100% of all BTC addresses became profitable, only to later pull back the coin’s value to $61,440.

Bitcoin’s price is picking up again after a brief lull: What levels and events should be watched for Bitcoin moving forward?
Bitcoin Price Reaches $68,000 Again

Volatility still seems prevalent in the digital currency ecosystem, but Bitcoin (BTC) has demonstrated resilience so far, bouncing back to the $68,000 level. Bitcoin bulls continue their relentless efforts, pushing the price up by 1.35% in the last 24 hours, lifting it above the intraday low of $65,655.53.
The BTC price entered the week with volatile movement in the $61,000 range, driven by sustained buying momentum from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. Supply squeeze triggered a rare buying momentum, propelling the Bitcoin price to an All-Time High (ATH) of $69,170.63.
Bitcoin’s price waited over two years to test its previous ATH, and according to predictions by the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock, nearly 100% of all BTC addresses became profitable. However, the coin later retraced its value to $61,440.
The coin made several attempts to return to ATH, but investors who were previously profitable remain skeptical about redirecting their capital into buying the coin again. Despite critics desiring a more devastating drop, the roller coaster has helped Bitcoin’s price stay above the psychologically significant level of $61,000.
When attention shifts to price, the influence of spot Bitcoin ETFs remains a decisive feature, continuing to shape the interest of institutional investors. With ongoing accumulation, Bitcoin advocates regard the correction as a healthy one that should assist in resetting the price of the leading digital currency.
Bitcoin Projections and Key Catalysts to Watch
At the current level, market experts, such as “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki, foresee a $300,000 price target for Bitcoin by the end of this year. Robert Kiyosaki’s optimism for BTC price has always been present, even before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Other advocates, such as Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood and individuals like Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, have larger projections of $600,000 and $1.5 million, respectively. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event is a significant trigger to complement the demand from existing spot BTC ETF products. If demand continues to be sustained after a 50% reduction in supply, the supply squeeze will be so intense that the market will price the cryptocurrency higher.
The BTC price is currently above both the 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages, indicating bullish market sentiment in both the short and long term.

The Bitcoin price is up 9% in seven days to trade for $66,921 as of 01:20 a.m. EST time.
BTC is up 1.5% over the past 24 hours on trading volume that slumped 30%, an indication of increased risk in the market amid speculation that large holders are manipulating the market.

Dear noobs,
Bitcoin is NOT naturally going down. It is being pushed down via whales placing spoofy sell orders on exchanges to make noobs and risk managers sell to ""buy back lower"". They are stealing your bags and will make you buy back at a higher price.

According to some traders, the lull in the BTC market, seen with the stalling Bitcoin price, is an opportunity for altcoins to start moving. @NCashOfficial says, “Euphoria really starts to flow once ATHs on Bitcoin are broken.”

The fun is just beginning.

However, @TheBitcoinTherapist believes the Bitcoin price “is at a breaking point, “adding that we are likely to see a break above $69,000, beyond which the BTC price could just keep pumping.

Feels like #Bitcoin is at a breaking point. Like any moment we will completely break well above $69,000 and just keep pumping.

However, the Bitcoin price remains within the November 2021 supply zone, extending from $59,864 to $67,760. An extension north is due soon, seeing as the Bitcoin price has confirmed the continuation of the trend. This is seen with the three-day candlestick close above the mean threshold of the supply zone at $63,948.
If buyers increased their buying momentum, the Bitcoin price could break above the $69,000 threshold, before potentially extending higher to flip the $69,324 blockade into a support. Such a move, which would render the supply zone a bullish breaker, could also see the BTC price trampoline to the $70,000 psychological level.



TradingView: BTC/USDT 3-day chart
Converse Case
On the flip side, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, the Bitcoin price could pull back, retracing the $60,784 support. A break and close below this level could see the Bitcoin price extend a leg south towards the $60,000. This would be an ideal buy opportunity for the late buyers and investors that were sidelined in the previous rally.
Meanwhile, as the Bitcoin price takes a breather, investors might want to consider diversifying some of their investments into a new ICO. GBTC is one such investment with greater upside potential, with Crypto YouTuber Jacob Bury anticipating 10X growth at launch.





Promising Alternative To Bitcoin
GBTC is the ticker for the Green Bitcoin ecosystem, a cryptocurrency project that combines the legacy of Bitcoin with the eco-friendly attributes of Ethereum. It introduces a unique, sustainable staking model called Gamified Green Staking, which allows users to earn passive income through staking rewards.

The project continues to gain significant attention, with its ongoing $GBTC token presale surging past $2.353 million already. The presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors to get involved in the project at a low entry price of $0.6882 per token. You can secure your tokens at this price now before a price hike in about four days.

You can also stake $GBTC tokens to earn an impressive annual percentage yield of 167%. So far, more than 3.462 million $GBTC tokens have been staked.



To further incentivize its community, Green Bitcoin also has a predict-to-earn feature, where users participate in daily BTC price prediction challenges. $GBTC tokens act as the stake as well as the reward, with rewards distributed every 10 minutes.

But Green Bitcoin is the only place where you can STAKE and EARN on those predictions! pic.twitter.com/yGgux4u9b9

This unique approach encourages community participation and helps to maintain the stability and growth of the $GBTC network.
Crypto analyst and YouTuber, Jacob Bury, believes $GBTC is set to soar before the Bitcoin halving event in April.

Binance Labs Invests in Seven Startups for Its Sixth Season,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Binance Labs Invests in Seven Startups for Its Sixth Season
With the rise in the cryptocurrency market, significant investment programs continue to emerge. Accordingly, Binance Labs, the venture capital and investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance with a market value of 10 billion dollars, has invested in seven startups for its 6th investment season program. The public announcement did not disclose the amount of investment made in the startups.
Notable Move by Binance Labs
On March 8th, Binance Labs announced that the seven startups include synthetic dollar protocol developer Ethena Labs, zkSync-based decentralized futures exchange Derivio, a purpose-driven DeFi protocol called Shogun aiming to maximize extractable value for investors, decentralized exchange trading platform UXUY, blockchain strategy game developer Cellula, AI-powered Web3 user-generated content platform NFPrompt, and AI-powered Web3 knowledge sharing platform QnA3.
Thus, the 6th season program that started last December has come to an end. The investment program initially included twelve startups, but ultimately, investments were made in seven. A Binance Labs spokesperson stated that the firm does not invest in all startups, the investment program is designed to support founders, and investments are not guaranteed.
For example, the 5th season of Binance Labs’ investment program last year made investments in five out of the initially selected twelve startups, including zkPass, Mind Network, and DappOS.

Binance Labs Continues Its Investment Efforts
Binance Labs is set to launch its 7th season program soon. Binance Labs is currently looking for visionary founders of early-stage projects to participate in the program and has announced that the application process is continuously open. Binance Labs’ investment programs attract a significant number of project applications.
Binance Labs reported that the 6th season program received hundreds of applications and ultimately selected 12 startups, or approximately 3% of the applicants. Recently, Binance Labs has increased its investment activities, supporting Bitcoin stake protocol Babylon and Ethereum restaking protocols Renzo and Puffer Finance this year. Last year, Binance Labs closed a 500 million dollar fund, accepting its first external capital, but the firm has begun returning unused capital to limited partners.

Polygon Price Prediction:Will the Matic History Repeat Again,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coingabbar,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"
Matic has exhibited an impressive recovery over the month, particularly bouncing off the $0.69 level.
The token underwent a strong breakout after consolidating for over a year, indicating potential for a significant uptrend.
Since being rejected from its long-term all-time high (ATH), the $MATIC price has been trading along a descending trend line.
On the daily chart, #Polygon is within a Descending channel pattern.
An ascending support line has provided stability during bearish pullbacks and supported a strong rebound.
The recent rebound enabled the price to break through upper resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend, reminiscent of the 2021 bull run's beginning.
The weekly chart suggests a similar pattern to the 2021 bull run, with the price breaking above a decisive triangle.
According to Coingabbar Price Analysis, Bulls need to maintain levels above $1.15 and close the weekly trade above these levels for continued bullish momentum.

SEC Delays Options Trading Approval for Spot Bitcoin ETFs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,UNLOCK_ENG,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"The decision by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been postponed. The SEC extended the response deadline for bids from the Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange, both seeking to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs. Additionally, the decision on Nasdaq’s bid to offer options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been delayed, with the SEC citing the need for more time to review the request.
The filing deadline for Bitcoin ETF options was January 25, and the SEC’s initial decision deadline was March 10. However, the SEC invoked its right to defer a decision, granting an additional 45 days under U.S. securities laws. Consequently, the SEC now has until April 24 to make a final decision on options trading for Bitcoin ETFs.
Options, as derivative products, provide traders with leverage, enabling them to make directional bets on the market. For instance, traders can purchase a “call option” if they anticipate Bitcoin’s price will rise, allowing them to buy 1 BTC at today’s price in a month’s time, while putting down a smaller amount of money compared to outright buying 1 BTC. If Bitcoin’s price increases during that month, the trader can exercise their option, potentially selling it for a profit. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price declines, the trader may choose to let the option contract expire, forfeiting the premium paid.
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has voiced support for the approval of options for Bitcoin ETFs, citing their potential to contribute to a robust and healthy market. Analysts, like VettaFi’s Dave Nadig, anticipate that the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options will attract hedge fund players, providing them with an opportunity to engage in the market.
In addition to options trading, the SEC is assessing seven spot Ether ETFs, with speculation that approval may occur by May 23, coinciding with the deadline for VanEck’s application. Furthermore, the SEC is reviewing multiple leveraged Bitcoin ETFs, including filings from asset manager Direxion, ProShares, and REX Shares.
SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently discussed the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, highlighting the agency’s “enforcement-only mode” and the need for clearer regulatory guidelines. Peirce emphasized that establishing clear rules upfront would be more effective in distinguishing between good and bad behavior in the cryptocurrency industry, rather than relying solely on enforcement actions.

SHIB Lead Shytoshi Kusama Issues Crucial Warning to Community,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-08 01:00:00,"

  Cover image via U.Today


Shiba Inu lead known under the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama has sent a message to the SHIB community warning them to beware of scams to do with SHIB meme coin and its ecosystem.
From time to time Kusama and SHIB’s marketing expert Lucie emerge on Twitter/X with similar warnings as the crypto space is offers plenty of opportunities not only for investors but also for scammers and con artists.
This time, Shytoshi Kusama warned the community against falling for scams to do with KNINE token launched by the recently announced Shibarium’s partner in liquid staking K9 Finance DAO.

Only use official guys here. Lots of scammers!!! Pay attention. https://t.co/J40w3N4yLr— Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) March 7, 2024

Kusama also spread the word about a closer integration between the SHIB team and the team of the aforementioned K9 Finance. Shytoshi Kusama and Shiba Inu lead developer Kaal Dhairya have been appointed K9’s official advisors. K9’s tweet hints that this appointment is related to the aforementioned launch of the KNINE token on the Layer-2 solution Shibarium.

Great to work with the team to bring more power to Shibarium. Another win in this incredible month! https://t.co/igbsx8pFhJ— Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) March 7, 2024

Shibarium team teases large SHIB burns coming
The aforementioned SHIB team member Lucie has tweeted that by now the SHIB team has set aside a massive 40 ETH from transaction fees for making SHIB burns. This is the equivalent of slightly more than $3,390 and is worth a whopping 4,690,279,616 Shiba Inu meme coins.
The team started SHIB burns at the end of November and burned chunks that contained billions of SHIB since then and until February. Thus they destroyed approximately 36 billion Shiba Inu by transferring them to unspendable wallets.
In January, the SHIB team started testing an automated mode for burning Shiba Inu. Lucie did not name any particular date when the burn will take place but she just recommended the SHIB army to watch out for further announcements.

🔥 $SHIB burns incoming! 40 ETH collected for the burn. Stay tuned! 👀— 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | SHIB.IO 🧜🏼‍♀️ (@LucieSHIB) March 8, 2024

Earlier this week, Lucie addressed the SHIB community on their frequent comments about the SHIB team allegedly doing nothing to increase burns.
In response to those, Lucie cited a message of the mysterious SHIB founder Ryoshi who disappeared from all the social media radars in 2022. Ryoshi advised those who is not happy with slow burns to start burning SHIB themselves.
So far, according to Shibburn, within the last 24 hours, the SHIB community has transferred a total of 48,209,535 SHIB meme coins out of the circulating supply with 42,466,919 SHIB being the largest chunk burned so far.","['SHIBA', 'KSM', 'KNINE', 'K9', 'SHIB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eada86cc420711a6230e49/

The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency has staged a dramatic recovery in the early months of 2024, boasting a nearly threefold increase in value and taking its place among the year’s top-performing digital currencies. Speculations are rife about SHIB reaching a significant price milestone, triggering widespread discussion about its potential market trajectory.
Changelly’s SHIB Price Forecast
Cryptocurrency exchange Changelly has offered a detailed forecast for SHIB’s price, projecting values up to the year 2050. Their 2024 projection, which includes minimum, average, and maximum price points, had been briefly surpassed by SHIB’s actual price, which soared beyond Changelly’s highest estimate on March 3rd, before retreating slightly.
While current predictions suggest that SHIB might hover around these values for the rest of the year, the volatile nature of the crypto market and Shiba Inu’s development team announcements could propel it to exceed expectations by the year’s end.
Future Price Targets for SHIB
For the year 2025, Changelly’s analysis points to a potential closing price for SHIB between their minimum and maximum predicted values. Going forward, the platform forecasts continued growth for SHIB in 2026, where it could beat its previous record highs.
Moreover, Changelly’s 2027 outlook suggests that SHIB might attain the much-anticipated $0.0001 price point, although algorithm-based predictions remain speculative due to the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and the myriad of factors influencing price movements.
Despite varying opinions on SHIB’s future, Changelly’s projections offer insights into what might lie ahead for Shiba Inu’s valuation, especially in light of statements from the cryptocurrency’s lead developer addressing SHIB’s potential to reach a $100 billion market cap.

Could Green Bitcoin (GBTC) Be a Better Investment for the Pre-Halving Bitcoin Rally?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"
Green Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency striving to be eco-friendly while rewarding early adopters, has recently entered its 30th stage in the presale.
The project has successfully raised over $2.3 million and aims to secure an additional 10% to achieve its full fundraising goal, offering $0.6882 per $GBTC.
An affordable, eco-friendly alternative amidst soaring Bitcoin prices
While Bitcoin continues its price surge, many investors are finding direct investment out of reach due to its massive market cap.





This has led them to seek alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly smaller ones that tend to follow similar price movements. Green Bitcoin emerges as a compelling option in this scenario, offering not only affordability but also a unique and sustainable approach.
Green Bitcoin prioritizes environmental responsibility by leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system. Compared to Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process, this reduces Green Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by a staggering 10,000 times.
But Green Bitcoin doesn’t stop at just being eco-friendly. It introduces a gamified staking model, a fun and engaging way for users to earn passive income. This system allows users to stake their Green Bitcoin tokens ($GBTC) and participate in daily challenges that test their Bitcoin price prediction skills.
By competing, users can win significant rewards, including bonuses of up to 100%. This innovative approach fosters a dynamic and interactive ecosystem that incentivizes participation. Green Bitcoin’s appeal is particularly strong in the current market.
With Bitcoin’s price soaring, a smaller investment in a low market cap altcoin like Green Bitcoin could potentially see a significant return. This presents an opportunity similar to investing in early Bitcoin, but at a much lower entry point.
Green Bitcoin offers the potential for high growth while maintaining a sustainable and engaging user experience. To gain a more profound understanding of this project’s potential value, you can explore our Green Bitcoin price prediction.
Gamified staking platform racks up $2.3 million in presale with massive 167% APY
Investors can now stake GBTC tokens and leverage a revolutionary gamified green staking system. The platform introduces fresh challenges weekly, ensuring an engaging experience for participants.
Currently, the total GBTC token stake stands at 3.4 million, with 64% of GBTC already staked. Stakers enjoy an annual reward of 167%, contributing to a total reward pool of 1.1 million. The next price increase is anticipated in just four days, and the presale allows purchases with Ethereum, USDT, and credit cards.
Notably, the project has introduced BNB as an alternative payment method to address the high fees associated with Ethereum transactions. However, it’s essential to note that opting for purchases on the BNB network disqualifies one from the 167% annual return through staking.
Therefore, Ethereum emerges as the preferred choice for those aiming for the highest possible returns. Alternatively, for step-by-step instructions on acquiring $GBTC, please refer to our comprehensive guide.
To participate in this presale or explore other opportunities, interested individuals can visit the top crypto ICOs to consider, a platform offering various presales in the crypto space.

"FLOKI Price Prediction: FLOKI Surges 48%, But Is Surpassed By This Relaunched Meme Coin That Soars To New All-Time High",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"
The FLOKI price surged more than 48% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.000183 as of 2:20 a.m. EST as investors go long on the meme coin.
The FLOKI Price Breaks Resistance



4-hour chart for FLOKI/USDT (Source: TradingView)
The FLOKI price was able to break above the resistance level at $0.00016318 and is currently attempting to flip the level into support. This is after it printed a series of higher highs and higher lows on its 4-hour chart. Should it remain above this threshold within the next 12 hours, it may continue climbing in the short term. 
This bullish thesis could be invalidated if the FLOKI price breaks below the $0.00016318 mark in the next 8 hours. In this alternative scenario, the meme coin may be exposed to the risk of falling to the closest support level at $0.00013075. 
Before it can reach this point, it still has the lower boundary of the aforementioned price channel as a line of defense. However, breaking out below the channel may signal a bearish shift in the crypto’s momentum. 
As such, the FLOKI price could plummet to as low as $0.00009650 in the following few days should it fall out of the channel.
The FLOKI Price May Keep Rising As Technicals Align
There is a lot of technical strength present on FLOKI’s 4-hour chart, suggesting the crypto’s price may keep rising in the coming 48 hours. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recently crossed above the MACD Signal line. This specific technical occurrence is generally seen as a sign that a crypto has entered into a bullish cycle. With the MACD line breaking away above the MACD Signal line, the positive trend also seems to be growing stronger.
Buyers have the upper hand on FLOKI’s 4-hour chart as well, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) line is breaking away above its Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. Similar to the MACD and MACD Signal lines, the RSI is breaking away above the SMA line. This suggests that bulls are growing stronger as well.
Traders and investors will want to note that the RSI is around 69, which shows that FLOKI is overbought. Although this is normally seen as a sell signal, it is also not unusual for the RSI to remain this high for sustained periods of time when a crypto is pumping.
As impressive as FLOKI’s 24-hour gain is, it was overshadowed by the over 52% gain SPONGE printed during the same period.
A History Of Whopping Gains
SPONGE defied the odds when it posted 100x growth during the 2023 bear market, pushing its market cap to a peak of $100 million and rewarding early investors handsomely. 
The team behind the meme coin have now decided to give investors who missed out on the substantial gains recorded by SPONGE last year a second opportunity, with the launch of Sponge V2.

To increase the chances of a repeat of its prior success, the SPONGE team has introduced several new elements and Features to the project’s ecosystem. Most notably is the migration from the Ethereum blockchain to the more scalable and cost-efficient Polygon network. 
There is also a play-to-earn racer game, which will come in both a paid and a free version. This brings a level of utility into the meme coin’s ecosystem, as the paid version will require players to top up their in-game credits with SPONGE. Players also stand the chance to earn rewards that are paid in the crypto.
Investors Anticipating Explosive Growth
More than $29.6 million has been staked and bridged on SPONGE’s official website, serving as a strong indication of how confident investors are in the potential for SPONGE’s price to skyrocket soon.





SPONGE can be bought using either USDT or ETH. Once purchased, the tokens can be staked for the 180% rewards being offered via the project’s taking program. 
If you are interested, buy soon because there are rumors the token will list on multiple top-tier exchanges imminently.

This event underscores the growing influence of digital currencies as promising investment avenues, setting the stage for our article's relevance in navigating the emerging crypto landscape.

Cardano's Market Fluctuation: A Potential Breakout or Reassessment?
Cardano's recent exclusion from Grayscale's new fund could lead to a short-term market fluctuation. Its current price stands at $0.75, just at the nearest resistance level, suggesting a potential breakout towards the next level of $0.85. Both RSI and Stochastic are neutral, but MACD and the 10-day simple moving average point towards buying, indicating optimism in the market.
Over the long term, this event could trigger a market reassessment of Cardano's value. The nearest support level at $0.52 and the second support at $0.38 might come into play if the price drops. However, the 100-day simple moving average, currently at $0.56, still recommends buying. This implies that even with this setback, Cardano's prospects remain bullish overall.
Optimism Coin Shows Promising Trend with Potential for Growth
Optimism is enjoying a promising upward trend. With a current price of $4.62, surpassing the nearest resistance level at $4.32, the momentum hints at a potential push towards the second resistance level of $4.95. The bullish Simple Moving Averages, along with the 'Buy' recommendation from MACD, add weight to this promising short-term projection.
On the other hand, we must balance optimism with caution. Holding steady above the nearest support at $2.95 is a positive signal, but the long-term viability will depend on the coin's ability to stay afloat. If the price dips, the second support level at $2.20 may come into play. Despite this, the Simple Moving Average 100-days 'Buy' recommendation insinuates gradual yet steady long-term growth.
Conclusion
While Cardano and Optimism exhibit bullish trends, the secret bull run signal seems to indicate that the real potential lies with BlastUP. Backed by the successful Blast ecosystem, BlastUP is poised to revolutionize the digital realm with its unique concept and commitment to propel the growth of blockchain startups. Even among other promising altcoins, BlastUP, with its strategic pre-sale and rich rewards system, arguably holds the highest potential, demonstrating that selecting the right coin can indeed translate into significant gains.

"Shiba Inu And WIF Rise High, But BlustUP Can Outperform Them 10X In Longer Term",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"
Bitcoin is hitting record highs, thanks partly to ETFs and SEC leader Gary Gensler. Amid this crypto surge, other digital assets are also making noise. Notably, Shiba Inu and WIF have risen strongly. However, an emerging crypto, BlustUP, is projected by some to outperform them both in the longer term. This shifting crypto climate showcases the importance of staying informed on the latest finance developments.

Potential Price Surge Expected for Shiba Inu Amid Upcoming Developments
The upcoming Shiba Inu developments have the potential to push the price upward. Given the current price of $0.000032, it may surge towards the nearest and second resistance levels of $0.0000152 and $0.000018, respectively. Predictions based on the MACD and simple moving averages over 10 and 100 days also suggest a buying opportunity, implying optimism.
On the other hand, risks should not be overlooked. Despite some suggestions to buy, RSI indicators recommend selling, and stochastic readings are neutral. With the nearest and second support levels being $0.00000931 and $0.00000605, there might be a downward adjustment if investor sentiment declines or development updates do not meet expectations. Stakeholders should remain vigilant to navigate volatility.
Dogwifhat's Price Surge: Analysis of Bullish Trend and Potential Risks
Dogwifhat has been on a roll, with its current price standing at $1.76. The coin's steadfast performance, hitting its second resistance level at $1.37 indicates a strong uptick. A continued surge could push it past the nearest resistance mark of $1.10. However, the RSI suggests a sell action, indicating potential overbought conditions. It's a careful balance between taking profits while the coin's value is relatively high and staying in the game to potentially reap larger rewards.
The MACD points to a buy opportunity, signaling a bullish trend over the short term. This is supported by the 10-day Simple Moving Average, which also prompts a buy action. However, with dogwifhat's nearest support pegged at $0.37, investing now could also bear risks. A sudden downturn could mean losses, especially since the Stochastic RSI is neutral, offering little sentiment information.  
Conclusion
As Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, and WIF continue to solidify their positions in the crypto realm, newcomers like BlastUP are proving themselves worthy of investor attention. Although Shiba Inu and WIF are posting solid gains, consider the potential of BlastUP in the Blast ecosystem as part of your portfolio. Its focus on quality and rewarding environment alone speaks volumes about its potential, not to mention the promise of future developments within its environment. As it stands, it's clear that BlastUP may offer the highest potential in this competitive crypto landscape.

Top 3 Coins New Investors Can Trust,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"

As the crypto market gets more attention, understanding which coins are reliable is crucial. This story will offer insights into trustworthy coins for new investors venturing into the volatile yet promising world of cryptocurrencies.

Pantera Capital's $250M Investment Could Boost Solana Beyond $160
Pantera Capital's $250 million projected investment in crypto may see Solana benefit significantly. This surge in liquidity can bolster SOL's price well beyond the current $148, with potential to exceed even the $160 second resistance level. A thriving investment encourages market traction, possibly attracting more investors to SOL. In the long-term, a steady influx of substantial investments could solidly maintain this upward trajectory.
On the other hand, it's vital to consider potential risks. Despite the optimistic outlook, there remain uncertainties in crypto investment, particularly regarding regulatory landscapes. Given that SOL's nearest support level stands at $101 and the second support at $76, this highlights potential short-term volatility. Should the regulatory environment turn unfavorable or if the investment fails to materialize as expected, a price correction could occur, unsettling SOL's current bullish trend.
Impressive Strides for Optimism: A Review of Project's Price Journey
Looking closely at Optimism's price journey, it's clear that the project has made impressive strides. With a current price of $4.70, it successfully surpassed the 10-day simple moving average of $4.06 and notably, the 100-day average of $3.20. These movements, coupled with neutral RSI and Stochastic RSI Fast recommendations, provide a calm aura for both short-term and long-term prospects.
The coin however, is still faced with the challenge of the nearest resistance level of $4.32, and even more so $4.95. On the downside, there are support levels placed at $2.95 and $2.20, reminding us that achieving stability above these points could present investing opportunities. The varied MACD and SMA indicators suggest an interesting pathway for Optimism in the market.
Conclusion
While Solana and Optimism reveal appealing prospects, none seems to harness the potential tied to the BlastUP. Offering predictability in a volatile space, BlastUP sets itself apart with its AI-infused, community-driven approach. Its token presale presents an attractive entry point into the promising Blast ecosystem. Despite other coins' potentials, BlastUP leads the way. Its ambitious agenda delivers a radical shakeup to the crypto world, making it a shining example for newcomers.

Amidst these exciting developments, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, has expressed his thoughts about Bitcoin ETFs, a move that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape.

Solana Shows Resilience Amid Market Uncertainty, Offers Short-Term Gains
Solana has shown pretty decent resilience, currently trading at $149, higher than the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of 128 and 97 respectively. The indicators recommend a ""buy"", offering short-term opportunities for gains. Its closest resistance is not far off at $143, and breaking that could pave the way toward $160, both ambitious yet realistic targets.
On the other hand, it's important not to overlook the potential risk factors. The nearest support level stands at $101, a significant drop from the current price. A further fall could take it as low as $76, the second support level. While the RSI and Stochastic remain neutral, these figures suggest potential long-term uncertainties. A constant watch on price movements is necessary for a balanced investment approach.
Polygon's Upgrade May Boost Short-term Momentum, Posing Long-term Growth
Should Polygon’s upgrade align with Ethereum’s Decun update, it may enhance investment interest, driving short-term price momentum. Given current prices and indicators, a potential breakout towards the second resistance at $1.27 isn't out of reach, boosted by the MACD and SMA's ""Buy"" recommendation.
While fee reductions align with Polygon's long-term strategy, market fluctuations and competitor volatility pose obstacles. Provided Polygon effectively implements EIP-4844, and navigating through near and second support levels at $0.82 and $0.63 respectively, prices could steadily rise towards the 100-day SMA of $0.88. But, remember the market's unsteady nature. Adaptability and caution are recommended for long-term investments.
Strong Uptrend Momentum of Optimism; Possible Pullback and Consolidation Phase
The current uptrend momentum of Optimism is strong, breaking past the $4 mark means that many holders are in profit territory. With a current price of $4.69 and a nearest resistance level at $4.32, there is a strong chance that this momentum will continue. The bullish long-term indicators like the MACD, 10-days, and 100-days SMAs all suggest a buy might push the price to test the second resistance level at $4.95.
Analyzing the short-term outlook, considering the recent break above $4 and current price hovering near $4.69, there might be a temporary pullback. This pullback could be a function of profit booking by short-term traders. Considering the nearest support level at $2.95, there may be an opportunity for investors looking to accumulate. With the RSI and Stochastic RSI indicating neutral, a consolidation phase before the next move upwards cannot be ruled out.
Cardano's Prospects amid Exclusion from Grayscale Fund
Looking at the recent changes in ADA, with Cardano being excluded from the new Grayscale fund, it could face some short-term challenges with maintaining its current price. However, don't overlook the data suggesting a Neutral RSI, a recommended MACD Buy, and strong support at $0.52, providing a believable scenario that ADA could surprise us by testing the next resistance level at $0.85.
On the other hand, the long-term horizon seems more optimistic for ADA. Despite the temporary setback with Grayscale, the consistent positive 100-days simple moving average indicates a potential for a steady rise. With its current price at $0.75, it's not out of the question that Cardano may navigate around these market swings and potentially edge higher, seeking the resistance of $0.85, provided the fundamentals cooperate.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the emerging altcoins, including Solana, Polygon, Optimism, and Cardano, demonstrate potential but also carry their own unique uncertainties. Nonetheless, the star of the show appears to be BlastUP, a relatively new project that's attracting attention due to its stability and rewarding DApp launches within the vibrant Blast ecosystem. With its AI and Web3 tools, BlastUP's potential for growth and transformation within the crypto sector is immense, making this the optimal time to get involved.

Potential Volatility Predicted for XRP Amid Legal and Market Uncertainty
In light of the ongoing legal proceedings and current market conditions, XRP's price could see some volatility. Its current price hovering around $0.63, with nearest resistance at $0.64 and further resistance at $0.70, indicates potential for an increase. Moreover, recommendations like the MACD and the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages also lean towards a purchase. This suggests possible upward movement, granted the legal complications resolve favorably.
However, if market winds shift, we could see XRP dip to its nearest support level at $0.51 or even further to $0.43. The RSI and Stochastic indicators remain somewhat neutral, reflecting uncertainty in the market. Thus, a cautious approach might welcome this potential dip as an opportunity to buy at lower levels, especially while keeping an eye on the evolving legal landscape. These factors allude to the market's cautious sentiment, reinforcing both the potential risks and opportunities for XRP.
Bonk's Positive Market Performance Advocates Buying Despite Risks
Bonk's current market performance presents a promising outlook, with the MACD and both 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages advocating a “buy”. Recounting the recent achievement of winning the Meme Coin of the Year, a spike in popularity could lead to the cryptocurrency gradually surpassing the nearest resistance of $0.0000286 and subsequently eyeing the second resistance at $0.0000351.
However, any investments should prioritize a balanced approach. Although Bonk enjoys the limelight because of the Memecoin award, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent volatility in cryptomarkets. Bonk's closest support level stands at $0.0000125, but a downturn could potentially push it to the second support level of $0.00000303. Efforts to understand both short-term and long-term risks are crucial.
Dogwifhat Surpasses Resistance Level, Shows Potential for Growth
Dogwifhat has managed to reach a new high, currently trading at $1.83, surpassing its nearest resistance level at $1.10. This impressive performance might continue in the short-term, especially if it breaks the second resistance level at $1.37. Yet, with the RSI recommending a sell and the Stochastic RSI at neutral, some level of caution is warranted.
In the long term, the scenario for Dogwifhat also poses opportunities and risks. Despite healthy climbs, the absence of a 100-day simple moving average has left us with a blank canvas. Nearest support levels suggest a potential fall to $0.37. MACD's buy action and the 10-day simple moving average at 1.33 suggest a buy action, indicating that there is room for growth despite volatility.
Conclusion
While XRP, Bonk, and Dogwifhat present potential opportunities within the altcoin market, they also carry risk due to unpredictable factors and market volatility. In contrast, BlastUP stands out as the most promising due to its concept and position in the rapidly growing 'Blast' ecosystem. Its token's presale and innovative launchpad features could catapult it to unprecedented heights in the crypto space. Yet all these coins suggest the altcoin market's thrilling dynamic nature, making it a key player in the future of cryptocurrency.

3 Best Crypto Altcoins to Buy In March 2024,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"
Bitcoin's recent record surge, largely driven by Gary Gensler's launch of the first U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, is causing ripples in the crypto world. This exciting shift is also turning heads toward potential crypto altcoins, which could offer lucrative opportunities this March. Understanding these market dynamics opens the door to our discussion on some stand-out crypto altcoins worth considering for investment in this favorable financial climate.

Cardano's MACD 'Buy' Signal Amidst Uncertainty and Exclusion from Grayscale Fund
Cardano’s current situation presents an intriguing dichotomy of possible scenarios. Despite being excluded from the new Grayscale fund, its pricing continues to display resilience, maintaining a robust position at $0.75. The additional bolstering of a MACD ‘buy’ recommendation indicates the potential for gradual upward progress, possibly pushing for the closest resistance level at $0.85, given the supportive backdrop of buying recommendations from 10 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages.
However, external marketplace factors could lead to a different trajectory. Although Cardano currently bounces between $0.75 and $0.85, it's important to remember the lurking lower support levels at $0.52 and $0.38. In a more cautious scenario where exclusion from significant financial products impacts investor sentiment, we might see Cardano retract and hover around these lower safety nets momentarily. The neutral RSI and Stochastic actions underline such possibility.
Optimism Value Ascends to $4 Mark, Aims Higher Amid Market Fluctuations
Optimism is grabbing attention as its value ascends to the $4 mark and it brings all its stakeholders into a winning situation. Behind this, regardless of a cautious resistance level at $4.32, Optimism's price could continue to strengthen its position, eyeing even the $4.95 value. Given its current price of $4.62 and the 10-day moving average at $4.05 and 100-day at $3.20, long-term growth prospects look promising.
On the flip side, especially in light of the neutral RSI and Stochastic RSI Fast indications, Optimism might experience a downward pressure towards its $2.95 or even $2.20 support levels, offering potential low-entry points. This could offer both small and large-scale investors opportunistic buy-ins, nudging them to go long due to the positive MACD recommendation. Keep in mind, the crypto realm always demands a careful watch.
SEI's Price Surge May Break Resistance Levels Amid Market Momentum
SEI's recent price surge could potentially push it above the nearest resistance level of $1.05, even touching the second resistance level at $1.27. This bullish scenario hinges on sustained market momentum, bolstered by the spectacular 210% daily increase. Conversely, the RSI and Stochastic RSI suggest a neutral standpoint, indicating that significant changes might not be forthcoming.
Despite the recent surge, the MACD action recommends selling, alluding to a possible price decline towards the nearest or even second support level. Historically, during such downturns, the 100-day simple moving average, currently at $0.61, acts as a reliable floor, offering long-term stability amidst short-term fluctuations. Yet, the 10-day moving average being above the current price hints at a potential near-term rebound.
Conclusion
While Cardano, Optimism, and SEI demonstrate potential in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, the exciting concept and rich rewards system of BlastUP make it a prime investment opportunity. As part of the innovative Blast ecosystem, BlastUP is designed to use AI tools to empower Web3 tools and help blockchain startups grow. Despite the lackluster performance of other coins, BlastUP's presale exhibits immense potential highlighting it as the must-watch altcoin for March 2024.

Skyrocketing Presale: Raffle Coin (RAFF) Sees Huge Interest from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Avalanche (AVAX) Traders in First Week,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Skyrocketing Presale: Raffle Coin (RAFF) Sees Huge Interest from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Avalanche (AVAX) Traders in First Week
In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, the presale of Raffle Coin (RAFF) has emerged as a focal point of interest for traders, especially those engaged in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Avalanche (AVAX). With a surge in participation observed within the first week, Raffle Coin (RAFF) decentralized platform promises a paradigm shift in traditional raffles.
As Bitcoin Cash (BCH) witnesses a notable weekly price increase and Avalanche (AVAX) grapples with technical challenges amidst price volatility, Raffle Coin (RAFF) presale maintains its upward trajectory, capturing the attention of traders seeking early investment opportunities.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Weekly Price Analysis
The weekly price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has seen a significant increase of 33.61%, fluctuating between $303 and $404. However, there is a risk of a potential bearish trend if the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price fails to maintain its position above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. In such a scenario, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may face initial support levels below $420, potentially leading to a decline in market price as it moves towards the lower boundary of the channel.
 With the 9-day moving average currently above the 21-day moving average, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could encounter critical support levels at $350, $330 and $310 in the event of bearish movement. Conversely, a significant upward swing above the upper boundary of the channel might propel Bitcoin Cash (BCH) towards a key resistance level at $550, potentially triggering a bullish rally. In this scenario, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could aim for resistance levels at $570.
Avalanche (AVAX) Faces Technical Challenges Amidst Price Volatility
The weekly price of Avalanche (AVAX) currently hovers between $40.0 and $40.4, reflecting a marginal decrease of 0.87%. Notably, Avalanche (AVAX) recently encountered a turbulent period when block production unexpectedly halted. This disruption, coinciding with the launch of a new feature, caused a temporary standstill in the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain for nearly two hours, resulting in a 3.7% decline in Avalanche (AVAX) price.
Despite the challenges faced, experts maintain a positive outlook on Avalanche (AVAX) future, anticipating a potential price increase. Avalanche (AVAX) demonstrates a bullish signal based on EMAs, with the 10-day EMA slightly above the 100-day EMA. While the RSI stands at 56.85, indicating a neutral stance, the Stochastic Oscillator readings suggest a short-term bearish trend, with a %K line at 71.18 and a %D signal line at 73.16.
Raffle Coin (RAFF) Presale Keeps Skyrocketing
Raffle Coin (RAFF) introduces a decentralized platform revolutionizing traditional raffles, providing users with the chance to win a variety of prizes, from cryptocurrencies to cars and holidays. Raffle Coin (RAFF) users can easily sign up for an account, instantly fund it with various cryptocurrencies and browse through a wide selection of raffle listings to participate in draws that pique their interest.
Currently, in Stage One of its presale, Raffle Coin (RAFF) tokens are available at a compelling price of $0.016, offering investors an early opportunity to support Raffle Coin (RAFF) growth. With a total of six presale stages planned and team tokens locked for two years, Raffle Coin (RAFF) presents significant potential for growth in the evolving crypto market.

Shiba Inu’s Remarkable Rise in the Crypto Market,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Shiba Inu’s Remarkable Rise in the Crypto Market
Shiba Inu, despite a rocky start to 2024, has shown a nearly 300% increase within a few days, becoming one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year. One of the most common questions surrounding the SHIB price is its potential to reach $0.0001. While the future of any cryptocurrency is uncertain, price predictions from crypto platforms can provide valuable insights into potential trajectories.
Insightful Analyst from Changelly
Leading cryptocurrency exchange Changelly has shared a prediction table for SHIB’s price extending up to the year 2050. The table presents three values for each year: minimum price, average price, and maximum price. Changelly predicts a minimum price of $0.0000349965, an average price of $0.0000359964, and a maximum price of $0.0000419958 for SHIB in 2024. SHIB recently exceeded the predicted maximum price, reaching $0.00004533 on March 3rd, before falling back to $0.00003176.
These predictions suggest that the SHIB price could remain at these levels for the remainder of 2024. However, anything can happen in the crypto market, and with a major announcement from Shiba Inu’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, SHIB could surpass these targets before the year ends.
What’s Expected for SHIB?
Changelly expects SHIB’s price to potentially close at a minimum of $0.0000509949, an average of $0.0000529947, or a maximum of $0.0000609939 in 2025. Changelly predicts a minimum price of $0.0000709929, an average price of $0.0000729927, and a maximum price of $0.0000889911 for SHIB in 2026, potentially surpassing its all-time high.
In 2027, Changelly’s prediction highlights SHIB potentially reaching the long-awaited $0.0001 mark with a minimum price of $0.0001059894, an average price of $0.000109989, and a maximum price of $0.0001259874. It’s crucial to remember that these predictions are based on algorithms and market analysis, and SHIB’s behavior can change, making it difficult to predict its future performance with absolute certainty. Numerous factors can influence SHIB’s price, complicating any definitive forecasts.

Nevertheless, Changelly analysts’ predictions provide a glimpse into the potential timeline for Shiba Inu reaching $0.0001, serving as a guide for crypto enthusiasts. While some crypto experts may doubt SHIB’s ability to reach such unprecedented heights, SHIB’s lead developer recently responded to predictions that SHIB could achieve a market value of $100 billion.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Surges 9% In A Week As New All-Time High Beckons And This Green BTC Presale Races Towards $2.5 Million,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"The Bitcoin price is up 9% in seven days to trade for $66,921 as of 01:20 a.m. EST time.
BTC is up 1.5% over the past 24 hours on trading volume that slumped 30%, an indication of increased risk in the market amid speculation that large holders are manipulating the market.

Dear noobs, 
Bitcoin is NOT naturally going down. It is being pushed down via whales placing spoofy sell orders on exchanges to make noobs and risk managers sell to ""buy back lower"". They are stealing your bags and will make you buy back at a higher price.
— Hsaka (@HsakaTrades) March 5, 2024


According to some traders, the lull in the BTC market, seen with the stalling Bitcoin price, is an opportunity for altcoins to start moving. @NCashOfficial says, “Euphoria really starts to flow once ATHs on Bitcoin are broken.”

The fun is just beginning.
Euphoria really starts to flow once ATHs on #Bitcoin are broken. Once this happens every single mainstream media source will be pushing the narrative.
Right now the number one thing that has been everywhere is the Bitcoin ETFs. MAX PAIN for the retail… pic.twitter.com/08TkOCydyM
— Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) March 8, 2024


However, @TheBitcoinTherapist believes the Bitcoin price “is at a breaking point, “adding that we are likely to see a break above $69,000, beyond which the BTC price could just keep pumping.

Feels like #Bitcoin is at a breaking point. Like any moment we will completely break well above $69,000 and just keep pumping.
I’m sitting tight, fully allocated as maximally as I can be and waiting patiently. I’ve got nothing left to give.

However, the Bitcoin price remains within the November 2021 supply zone, extending from $59,864 to $67,760. An extension north is due soon, seeing as the Bitcoin price has confirmed the continuation of the trend. This is seen with the three-day candlestick close above the mean threshold of the supply zone at $63,948.
If buyers increased their buying momentum, the Bitcoin price could break above the $69,000 threshold, before potentially extending higher to flip the $69,324 blockade into a support. Such a move, which would render the supply zone a bullish breaker, could also see the BTC price trampoline to the $70,000 psychological level.

TradingView: BTC/USDT 3-day chart
Converse Case
On the flip side, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, the Bitcoin price could pull back, retracing the $60,784 support. A break and close below this level could see the Bitcoin price extend a leg south towards the $60,000. This would be an ideal buy opportunity for the late buyers and investors that were sidelined in the previous rally.
Meanwhile, as the Bitcoin price takes a breather, investors might want to consider diversifying some of their investments into a new ICO. GBTC is one such investment with greater upside potential, with Crypto YouTuber Jacob Bury anticipating 10X growth at launch.

Promising Alternative To Bitcoin
GBTC is the ticker for the Green Bitcoin ecosystem, a cryptocurrency project that combines the legacy of Bitcoin with the eco-friendly attributes of Ethereum. It introduces a unique, sustainable staking model called Gamified Green Staking, which allows users to earn passive income through staking rewards.

The project continues to gain significant attention, with its ongoing $GBTC token presale surging past $2.353 million already. The presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors to get involved in the project at a low entry price of $0.6882 per token. You can secure your tokens at this price now before a price hike in about four days.

You can also stake $GBTC tokens to earn an impressive annual percentage yield of 167%. So far, more than 3.462 million $GBTC tokens have been staked.

To further incentivize its community, Green Bitcoin also has a predict-to-earn feature, where users participate in daily BTC price prediction challenges. $GBTC tokens act as the stake as well as the reward, with rewards distributed every 10 minutes.

Polygon and Cardano Investors are Eyeing up Algotech (ALGT) Presale!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has set new yearly highs, and the Ethereum (ETH) ETF is already inevitable. Major altcoins are following this lead; now is the time to participate in presales.Small-caps have massive potential in the current conditions, and Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) investors are eyeing up the Algotech (ALGT) presale. Could it be 2024’s best presale? Here’s why investors are rotating from the best cryptocurrencies to buy in the 2021 cycle to the next wave of up-and-comers of the 2024/ 2025 cycle.
Polygon (MATIC) Overvalued?
 Polygon (MATIC) has struggled in this bull market compared to its other scaling competitors. Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) have seriously outperformed Polygon (MATIC), and this lagging performance is due to an overvaluation from the last cycle. Polygon (MATIC) was one of the first teams that set out to scale Ethereum from the Polygon (MATIC) PoS sidechain to its more recent ZKRollup endeavours.In a surprise move, Polygon (MATIC) cut a large percentage of its workforce to return to a leaner and more focused build. But it appears that Polygon (MATIC) holders are looking for greener pastures, and on-chain data sees massive rotations into the Algotech presale.
Cardano (ADA) DeFi TVL Crosses $500 Million
Cardano (ADA) has undergone an incredible bear market journey, and this scalable alternative layer one gained smart contract functionality after the Alonzo upgrade. Since Cardano (ADA) has seen its ecosystem grow while still not justifying Cardano’s (ADA) wild multi-billion dollar valuation, its $600 million DeFi ecosystem is a step in the right direction.Liquid staking tokens have been a vital primitive for the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem to grow, and Minswap, the largest DEX on Cardano (ADA), now boasts a TVL of over $100 million. But Cardano (ADA) investors are slowly exiting to participate in what could be this year’s best presale. Algotech promises higher returns, and Cardano (ADA) holders are not sticking around letting them pass them by.
Algotech (ALGT) Next-Gen AI Trading Platform
Algotech (ALGT) is an advanced algorithmic trading platform that puts traders in the driver’s seat and gives them a serious edge over their competitors. It blends machine learning algorithms and decentralized architecture to provide hundreds of trading strategies. Algotech (ALGT) being called the best crypto to buy now should come as no surprise. This decentralized marketplace connects traders with the tools and strategies they need to automate their trading activities and ramp up their returns.Built by traders for traders and surging on the AI narrative, Algotech (ALGT) has already raised an impressive $1.5 million. Leveraging machine learning constantly updates Algotech’s (ALGT) models, and the platform lets traders automate execution and remove emotional bias. Its emphasis on risk management ensures suitable sizing, and Algotech (ALGT) is the perfect tool to maximize profits in the massive volatility that always accompanies bull markets.Breakout trading, arbitrage, mean reversion, and trend following are some of its most basic strategies, and AI powers all of these. It has the throughout for HFT, is fully regulatory compliant, and $ALGT token holders enjoy platform revenue share. Surfing the AI narrative perfectly, price predictions already forecast a 50X for ALGT this year, and its impressive roadmap could lift it even higher.Learn more:

Experts Believe Rebel Satoshi To Be the Next Moon Coin While Meme Coins Like Shiba Inu and PEPE Explode,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"TLDR

The Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) token is anticipated to give 100x gains upon its exchange launch. 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is projected to continue its rally and rise above $0.0000300. 
Experts predict that the PEPE token will continue rising and trade above $0.0000075.

As the market continues to surge, the best altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE have exploded. Meanwhile, with the Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) presale coming to an end, its investors are waiting for the upcoming exchange listing. Let’s understand what makes SHIB, PEPE, and $RBLZ the best cryptos to buy ahead of other top altcoins. 
Rebel Satoshi Projected To Rise Astronomically Upon Exchange Listing
The Rebel Satoshi project is inspired by the ethos and ideals of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. Rebel Satoshi is designed to bring a revolution in the market and challenge the growing centralization. The Recusant community members of Rebel Satoshi will lead its rebellion and take back control from the elites. 
The Rebel Satoshi movement is built around its native $RBLZ token built on the Ethereum network. Rebel Satoshi has fixed the total supply of the $RBLZ token at 250 million. The audacious aim of Rebel Satoshi is to take the $RBLZ token to a $100 million market cap. The presale of the $RBLZ token came to an end on February 29, with $RBLZ rising by 150% to $0.025. 
Rebel Satoshi has listed the $RBLZ token on Uniswap and Coinstore. Moreover, exclusive merch will be available on the Rebel Satoshi site in March. Experts predict that the $RBLZ token will explode once it is available for trading on exchanges. As a result, they consider $RBLZ the best crypto to invest in for skyrocketing gains.

Shiba Inu Breaks Downtrend as Further Surge Anticipated
The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token had been performing rather underwhelmingly in the recent market surge until last week. Since the beginning of the year, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been trading and was caught up in market volatility. However, in the past week, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has broken its downtrend. 
On February 26, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token was trading sideways at $0.0000094. Since then, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has risen by 176% to trade at $0.0000267 on March 4. A major reason behind the Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge has been the growth of its L2 network Shibarium. As of March 4, the total transactions on Shibarium have exceeded 395 million. 
With the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem constantly growing, experts are bullish on it. They predict that the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token will rise above $0.0000300 in the coming months. 
PEPE Skyrockets to a New All-Time High After Robinhood Listing
Since the beginning of 2024, the PEPE token has been declining. However, as the market turned bullish, PEPE also witnessed a bounce. This bounce was transformed into a massive rally, taking PEPE to a new all-time high. A major reason behind the PEPE rally is its listing on Robinhood in select EU jurisdictions on February 14. 
On February 15, the PEPE token was trading at $0.0000012 and has since continued to rise. As of March 4, the PEPE token was trading at an all-time high of $0.0000066 with a rally of 450%. Amid the surge, Coinmarketcap nominated PEPE as the Meme Coin Of The Year on February 29. 
With these in mind, experts are bullish on the PEPE token going forward. They predict that the PEPE price will continue its rally and rise above $0.0000075 in the coming months.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Surges 9% In A Week As New All-Time High Beckons And This Green BTC Presale Races Towards $2.5 Million,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"The Bitcoin price is up 9% in seven days to trade for $66,921 as of 01:20 a.m. EST time.
BTC is up 1.5% over the past 24 hours on trading volume that slumped 30%, an indication of increased risk in the market amid speculation that large holders are manipulating the market.

Dear noobs, 
Bitcoin is NOT naturally going down. It is being pushed down via whales placing spoofy sell orders on exchanges to make noobs and risk managers sell to ""buy back lower"". They are stealing your bags and will make you buy back at a higher price.
— Hsaka (@HsakaTrades) March 5, 2024


According to some traders, the lull in the BTC market, seen with the stalling Bitcoin price, is an opportunity for altcoins to start moving. @NCashOfficial says, “Euphoria really starts to flow once ATHs on Bitcoin are broken.”

The fun is just beginning.
Euphoria really starts to flow once ATHs on #Bitcoin are broken. Once this happens every single mainstream media source will be pushing the narrative.
Right now the number one thing that has been everywhere is the Bitcoin ETFs. MAX PAIN for the retail… pic.twitter.com/08TkOCydyM
— Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) March 8, 2024


However, @TheBitcoinTherapist believes the Bitcoin price “is at a breaking point, “adding that we are likely to see a break above $69,000, beyond which the BTC price could just keep pumping.

Feels like #Bitcoin is at a breaking point. Like any moment we will completely break well above $69,000 and just keep pumping.
I’m sitting tight, fully allocated as maximally as I can be and waiting patiently. I’ve got nothing left to give.

However, the Bitcoin price remains within the November 2021 supply zone, extending from $59,864 to $67,760. An extension north is due soon, seeing as the Bitcoin price has confirmed the continuation of the trend. This is seen with the three-day candlestick close above the mean threshold of the supply zone at $63,948.
If buyers increased their buying momentum, the Bitcoin price could break above the $69,000 threshold, before potentially extending higher to flip the $69,324 blockade into a support. Such a move, which would render the supply zone a bullish breaker, could also see the BTC price trampoline to the $70,000 psychological level.

TradingView: BTC/USDT 3-day chart
Converse Case
On the flip side, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, the Bitcoin price could pull back, retracing the $60,784 support. A break and close below this level could see the Bitcoin price extend a leg south towards the $60,000. This would be an ideal buy opportunity for the late buyers and investors that were sidelined in the previous rally.
Meanwhile, as the Bitcoin price takes a breather, investors might want to consider diversifying some of their investments into a new ICO. GBTC is one such investment with greater upside potential, with Crypto YouTuber Jacob Bury anticipating 10X growth at launch.

Promising Alternative To Bitcoin
GBTC is the ticker for the Green Bitcoin ecosystem, a cryptocurrency project that combines the legacy of Bitcoin with the eco-friendly attributes of Ethereum. It introduces a unique, sustainable staking model called Gamified Green Staking, which allows users to earn passive income through staking rewards.

The project’s gamified staking system allows users to participate in daily and weekly BTC price prediction challenges, with the potential to earn attractive rewards.

— GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) February 25, 2024


The project continues to gain significant attention, with its ongoing $GBTC token presale surging past $2.353 million already. The presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors to get involved in the project at a low entry price of $0.6882 per token. You can secure your tokens at this price now before a price hike in about four days.

You can also stake $GBTC tokens to earn an impressive annual percentage yield of 167%. So far, more than 3.462 million $GBTC tokens have been staked.

To further incentivize its community, Green Bitcoin also has a predict-to-earn feature, where users participate in daily BTC price prediction challenges. $GBTC tokens act as the stake as well as the reward, with rewards distributed every 10 minutes.

But Green Bitcoin is the only place where you can STAKE and EARN on those predictions! pic.twitter.com/yGgux4u9b9
— GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) February 16, 2024


This unique approach encourages community participation and helps to maintain the stability and growth of the $GBTC network.
Crypto analyst and YouTuber, Jacob Bury, believes $GBTC is set to soar before the Bitcoin halving event in April.

Polygon and Cardano Investors are Eyeing up Algotech (ALGT) Presale!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has set new yearly highs, and the Ethereum (ETH) ETF is already inevitable. Major altcoins are following this lead; now is the time to participate in presales.Small-caps have massive potential in the current conditions, and Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) investors are eyeing up the Algotech (ALGT) presale. Could it be 2024’s best presale? Here’s why investors are rotating from the best cryptocurrencies to buy in the 2021 cycle to the next wave of up-and-comers of the 2024/ 2025 cycle.
Polygon (MATIC) Overvalued?
 Polygon (MATIC) has struggled in this bull market compared to its other scaling competitors. Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) have seriously outperformed Polygon (MATIC), and this lagging performance is due to an overvaluation from the last cycle. Polygon (MATIC) was one of the first teams that set out to scale Ethereum from the Polygon (MATIC) PoS sidechain to its more recent ZKRollup endeavours.In a surprise move, Polygon (MATIC) cut a large percentage of its workforce to return to a leaner and more focused build. But it appears that Polygon (MATIC) holders are looking for greener pastures, and on-chain data sees massive rotations into the Algotech presale.
Cardano (ADA) DeFi TVL Crosses $500 Million
Cardano (ADA) has undergone an incredible bear market journey, and this scalable alternative layer one gained smart contract functionality after the Alonzo upgrade. Since Cardano (ADA) has seen its ecosystem grow while still not justifying Cardano’s (ADA) wild multi-billion dollar valuation, its $600 million DeFi ecosystem is a step in the right direction.Liquid staking tokens have been a vital primitive for the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem to grow, and Minswap, the largest DEX on Cardano (ADA), now boasts a TVL of over $100 million. But Cardano (ADA) investors are slowly exiting to participate in what could be this year’s best presale. Algotech promises higher returns, and Cardano (ADA) holders are not sticking around letting them pass them by.
Algotech (ALGT) Next-Gen AI Trading Platform
Algotech (ALGT) is an advanced algorithmic trading platform that puts traders in the driver’s seat and gives them a serious edge over their competitors. It blends machine learning algorithms and decentralized architecture to provide hundreds of trading strategies. Algotech (ALGT) being called the best crypto to buy now should come as no surprise. This decentralized marketplace connects traders with the tools and strategies they need to automate their trading activities and ramp up their returns.Built by traders for traders and surging on the AI narrative, Algotech (ALGT) has already raised an impressive $1.5 million. Leveraging machine learning constantly updates Algotech’s (ALGT) models, and the platform lets traders automate execution and remove emotional bias. Its emphasis on risk management ensures suitable sizing, and Algotech (ALGT) is the perfect tool to maximize profits in the massive volatility that always accompanies bull markets.Breakout trading, arbitrage, mean reversion, and trend following are some of its most basic strategies, and AI powers all of these. It has the throughout for HFT, is fully regulatory compliant, and $ALGT token holders enjoy platform revenue share. Surfing the AI narrative perfectly, price predictions already forecast a 50X for ALGT this year, and its impressive roadmap could lift it even higher.Learn more:

Experts Believe Rebel Satoshi To Be the Next Moon Coin While Meme Coins Like Shiba Inu and PEPE Explode,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"TLDR

The Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) token is anticipated to give 100x gains upon its exchange launch. 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is projected to continue its rally and rise above $0.0000300. 
Experts predict that the PEPE token will continue rising and trade above $0.0000075.

As the market continues to surge, the best altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE have exploded. Meanwhile, with the Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) presale coming to an end, its investors are waiting for the upcoming exchange listing. Let’s understand what makes SHIB, PEPE, and $RBLZ the best cryptos to buy ahead of other top altcoins. 
Rebel Satoshi Projected To Rise Astronomically Upon Exchange Listing
The Rebel Satoshi project is inspired by the ethos and ideals of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. Rebel Satoshi is designed to bring a revolution in the market and challenge the growing centralization. The Recusant community members of Rebel Satoshi will lead its rebellion and take back control from the elites. 
The Rebel Satoshi movement is built around its native $RBLZ token built on the Ethereum network. Rebel Satoshi has fixed the total supply of the $RBLZ token at 250 million. The audacious aim of Rebel Satoshi is to take the $RBLZ token to a $100 million market cap. The presale of the $RBLZ token came to an end on February 29, with $RBLZ rising by 150% to $0.025. 
Rebel Satoshi has listed the $RBLZ token on Uniswap and Coinstore. Moreover, exclusive merch will be available on the Rebel Satoshi site in March. Experts predict that the $RBLZ token will explode once it is available for trading on exchanges. As a result, they consider $RBLZ the best crypto to invest in for skyrocketing gains.

Shiba Inu Breaks Downtrend as Further Surge Anticipated
The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token had been performing rather underwhelmingly in the recent market surge until last week. Since the beginning of the year, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been trading and was caught up in market volatility. However, in the past week, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has broken its downtrend. 
On February 26, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token was trading sideways at $0.0000094. Since then, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has risen by 176% to trade at $0.0000267 on March 4. A major reason behind the Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge has been the growth of its L2 network Shibarium. As of March 4, the total transactions on Shibarium have exceeded 395 million. 
With the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem constantly growing, experts are bullish on it. They predict that the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token will rise above $0.0000300 in the coming months. 
PEPE Skyrockets to a New All-Time High After Robinhood Listing
Since the beginning of 2024, the PEPE token has been declining. However, as the market turned bullish, PEPE also witnessed a bounce. This bounce was transformed into a massive rally, taking PEPE to a new all-time high. A major reason behind the PEPE rally is its listing on Robinhood in select EU jurisdictions on February 14. 
On February 15, the PEPE token was trading at $0.0000012 and has since continued to rise. As of March 4, the PEPE token was trading at an all-time high of $0.0000066 with a rally of 450%. Amid the surge, Coinmarketcap nominated PEPE as the Meme Coin Of The Year on February 29. 
With these in mind, experts are bullish on the PEPE token going forward. They predict that the PEPE price will continue its rally and rise above $0.0000075 in the coming months.

World's First ICO on Bitcoin Blockchain Enters Final 7 Day Countdown (8 Mar),COIN_MARKET_CAP,Chainwire,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"London, United Kingdom, March 8th, 2024, Chainwire

Bitcoin Dogs, the first ever ICO on the Bitcoin Blockchain, has announced a presale end date of the 15th March, which marks it's final 7 days remaining.
The project has raised over $8.1m in under 23 days, with investors buying 0DOG token.
With a community which has built to 150,000 in just 3 weeks, and over 10,000 buyers so far, the team hopes this momentum and growth continues.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_eyofSTlHc 
Building on Bitcoin
Driven by the 0DOG token, Bitcoin Dogs is both a GameFi experience centered around raising and training virtual dogs and a 10,000-strong NFT collection minted on BRC-20. The incredible reception from the crypto community is driven by 0DOG’s innovative approach to the latest Bitcoin development as well as its fun retro graphics, community focus, and the chance for players to earn 0DOG in PvP competitions.
The game will begin beta testing in Q2, and 10,000 Ordinals NFTs will launch at the same time - with token holders getting early access to the collection. Full details of the project concept as well as the roadmap are all available in the whitepaper, and the team has been welcoming questions on any of their social channels.
Shaping BRC-20 History
810 million tokens are available in the presale—that’s 90% of the 900 million total supply, a figure corresponding to the total number of dogs on Earth (“one token for every snout and paw on the planet”).
Complementing this attractive proposition is a unique purchasing methodology, all explained in the Bitcoin Dogs how-to-buy video. Bitcoin Dogs navigates the logistics of this being the first-ever ICO on the BTC blockchain with elegance: presale buys can be made via Ethereum and a range of ERC-20 stablecoins. 
Then, upon presale completion, these will be converted into BRC-20 0DOG tokens. Investors will be required to provide a Bitcoin address upon purchase. 
The revolution of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are technologies are made possible by implementing data onto the smallest denomination of Bitcoin: Satoshis. 
These additions to the original blockchain bring new features and utility to Bitcoin while retaining the security and permanence the chain is known for. BRC-20 tokens have enjoyed huge rallies in recent months, and Ordinals NFTs are expected to lead the market into 2024..
The project has also been mentioned on CoinTelegraph, Bitcoin.com, DeCrypt, CoinMarketCap, and many more leading publications, and has enjoyed viral success on social media, and leading influencers, including @MrX_Crypto, @BscSuperAltcoin, and @BscGemsX1000, have announced their support.
0DOG is currently available for $0.0343, with the presale ending on the 15th of March at a final price of $0.0404.
0DOG is available to buy on the Bitcoin Dogs website until the 15th of March.
About Bitcoin Dogs
Bitcoin Dogs is breaking new ground in the Bitcoin ecosystem. For the first time ever, NFTs, gaming, and new token types come together to offer the first ICO on the original Bitcoin blockchain. The truly permissionless immutability of Bitcoin is being harnessed to create the 0DOG token, while a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming experience and NFT collection are being developed exclusively for 0DOG holders.

Storj Spotlighted by Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin as Decentralized Storage Gains Focus,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Storj Spotlighted by Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin as Decentralized Storage Gains Focus
Ethereum‘s co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently discussed the prospects of decentralized protocols such as Storj, a blockchain-based cloud storage platform. In his latest Warpcast blog post, he questions the project’s progress and adoption despite its long existence and innovative technology.
Challenges and Opportunities for Decentralized Storage
Buterin points out that despite Storj’s novel approach to data storage, it has not yet achieved considerable traction. He believes that understanding the factors hindering widespread adoption of such projects is crucial to unlocking their potential.
His analysis suggests that these decentralized storage solutions may be on the cusp of gaining renewed interest. Buterin encourages stakeholders to watch for signs of increased adoption and to consider how such platforms could represent a shift in data storage practices within the digital asset space.
Market Reactions to Buterin’s Endorsement
Aligned with Buterin’s remarks, the market valuation of Storj’s corresponding token experienced a notable surge. The cryptocurrency‘s price witnessed over a 20% increase shortly after the blog post, reflecting market optimism fueled by the endorsement of a respected figure in the blockchain community.
Although a slight decrease followed, the token’s price remained significantly higher than before Buterin’s blog post. Market analysts are closely observing Storj, predicting a potential rally inspired by its highlighted promise in decentralized data solutions.

Vitalik Buterin Highlights Potential of DePIN Projects like Storj,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Vitalik Buterin Highlights Potential of DePIN Projects like Storj
Ethereum‘s co-founder and leading figure Vitalik Buterin recently brought up questions about the potential success of “DePIN” (Decentralized Protocol Innovation Network) projects, specifically mentioning Storj (STORJ) in a blog post on Warpcast.
Buterin Draws Attention to DePIN Projects Through Storj
Referencing Storj and similar initiatives as examples of DePIN category projects, Buterin emphasized that these projects have existed for over a decade without significant progress. Despite its innovative approach to data storage, Storj, as Buterin highlighted, has yet to find the widespread adoption it seeks.

Buterin’s comments explain why projects like Storj, after years of limited success, might now attract interest. The co-founder of Ethereum suggests closely monitoring factors that could revive interest and adoption in decentralized storage solutions and similar DePIN projects.
The mention of Storj by a prominent figure like Buterin situates the altcoin’s innovation within a broader discussion about the growing importance of decentralized storage platforms. Despite past issues and setbacks, his comments have already sparked optimism about the potential of projects like Storj to transform traditional data storage methods within the crypto world.
STORJ’s Price Soars Following Blog Post
Indeed, Buterin’s direct emphasis on cloud storage solutions and DePIN projects has stirred the altcoin’s price. The native asset STORJ, sharing its name with the network, saw its price jump over 20% to $0.9248 in a short period.
According to data from CoinMarketCap, STORJ experienced a slight pullback but was still trading at $0.905, up 15.56% in the last 24 hours at the time this article was prepared. Market observers are noting that STORJ could rally strongly following the Ethereum co-founder’s remarks.

Bitcoin’s Recurring Pattern Suggests $92.5K Could Be The Next Milestone,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to rally towards or above $90,000 in the coming weeks due to technical, on-chain, and fundamental indicators.
Increased capital inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and a historical price pattern also suggest a potential price surge.

Bitcoin’s price appears set to surge towards or even surpass $90,000 in the upcoming weeks. This is due to a combination of supportive factors including technical, on-chain, and fundamental indicators.
Bullish Indicators for Bitcoin
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a consolidation phase, moving within a triangular formation that resembles a bull pennant. This comes after the cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high of $69,210.
Bull pennants are seen by traditional analysts as bullish continuation patterns that could lead to a price increase. This is usually accompanied by an increased trading volume.
The likelihood of a Bitcoin price breakout is currently high as the price consolidates, especially after reaching new all-time highs this week. As such, the next target could be around $92,500 in the coming weeks, which is a 35% increase from current levels.
Increased Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs
The recent uptrend in Bitcoin’s price has coincided with increased capital inflows into U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs currently hold over $53 billion in their reserves, a significant increase from $27.95 billion at their launch in January.
Higher inflows into an ETF suggest an increase in investor demand for shares of the ETF, which in turn increases demand for the underlying assets. This is because the fund manager may need to purchase additional assets to ensure the ETF accurately reflects the index composition or sector it tracks.
Furthermore, the increased ETF inflows come just weeks ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Historically, halving events have been associated with increases in the price before and after the mining reward is cut in half.
Historical Price Pattern Suggests More Gains
Bitcoin’s current price action also closely resembles a historical fractal before its price rally toward $69,000 in November 2021. These similar drawdowns around all-time high prices suggest that the next leg up might be imminent, much like during the last bull cycle.
If history repeats with a successful breakout, Bitcoin’s price could be targeting prices north of $75,000.","['BTC', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'GAINS']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ead266e4cf6115bca458f4/
Core Scientific Brings AI Partnership Ahead of Halving,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Bitcoin mining giant Core Scientific is making strategic moves to diversify its revenue streams in anticipation of the impending Bitcoin halving. The company has entered into a significant partnership with artificial intelligence startup CoreWeave to provide data center services, projecting potential revenue exceeding $100 million.
Data Center Lease in Austin
Core Scientific’s expansion involves leasing a Tier 3 data center in Austin, Texas, formerly housing Hewlett Packard, to accommodate CoreWeave’s infrastructure. The contract outlines the delivery of up to 16 megawatts of capacity at this new Austin data center. This makes Core Scientific’s foray into high-performance computing (HPC).
CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing company, boasts backing from major Wall Street financial firms, including Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Fidelity. Valued at $7 billion as of December 2023, CoreWeave specializes in providing infrastructure for compute-intensive use cases, such as machine learning.
Previous Collaboration
Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan emphasized the strategic significance of the new data center in Austin, serving both CoreWeave’s needs and expanding Core Scientific’s hosting customer portfolio in bitcoin mining and specialized GPU cloud compute.
Notably, Core Scientific had previously hosted CoreWeave’s GPU processing hardware in its data centers from 2019 through 2022.
Business Model Flexibility
With over 300 MW of energized infrastructure in multiple U.S. states, Core Scientific operates in close proximity to major metropolitan areas, ensuring access to high-bandwidth telecommunications infrastructure—a crucial factor for supporting GPU cloud compute workloads. Sullivan stated:

“We believe today’s Core Scientific has the valuable ability to flex our asset base in order to maximize revenue and earnings. Our diversified business model and leading scale enable us to continue operating as a low-cost bitcoin miner while also expanding our hosting customer base and diversifying our earnings streams.”

Further Growth Plans
As of January 31, 2024, Core Scientific operates seven data centers in five U.S. states, most with a minimum operating capacity of 100MW, totaling an impressive 724 MW of operating capacity.
The company’s growth plan outlines a substantial expansion of 372 MW in bitcoin mining infrastructure at its two Texas data centers, equivalent to over 20 exahash of mining capacity. Core Scientific’s self-mining business has consistently outperformed other listed bitcoin miners in North America, delivering higher hash rate utilization than the average for its North American peer group.
Core Scientific’s expansion of service offerings comes strategically just weeks ahead of the Bitcoin halving event in 2024. This event, following previous halvings in 2020, 2016, and 2012, will halve the block reward for miners from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.

Could Green Bitcoin (GBTC) Be a Better Investment for the Pre-Halving Bitcoin Rally?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Green Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency striving to be eco-friendly while rewarding early adopters, has recently entered its 30th stage in the presale.
The project has successfully raised over $2.3 million and aims to secure an additional 10% to achieve its full fundraising goal, offering $0.6882 per $GBTC.
An affordable, eco-friendly alternative amidst soaring Bitcoin prices
While Bitcoin continues its price surge, many investors are finding direct investment out of reach due to its massive market cap.

This has led them to seek alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly smaller ones that tend to follow similar price movements. Green Bitcoin emerges as a compelling option in this scenario, offering not only affordability but also a unique and sustainable approach.
Green Bitcoin prioritizes environmental responsibility by leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system. Compared to Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process, this reduces Green Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by a staggering 10,000 times.
But Green Bitcoin doesn’t stop at just being eco-friendly. It introduces a gamified staking model, a fun and engaging way for users to earn passive income. This system allows users to stake their Green Bitcoin tokens ($GBTC) and participate in daily challenges that test their Bitcoin price prediction skills.
By competing, users can win significant rewards, including bonuses of up to 100%. This innovative approach fosters a dynamic and interactive ecosystem that incentivizes participation. Green Bitcoin’s appeal is particularly strong in the current market.
With Bitcoin’s price soaring, a smaller investment in a low market cap altcoin like Green Bitcoin could potentially see a significant return. This presents an opportunity similar to investing in early Bitcoin, but at a much lower entry point.
Green Bitcoin offers the potential for high growth while maintaining a sustainable and engaging user experience. To gain a more profound understanding of this project’s potential value, you can explore our Green Bitcoin price prediction.
Gamified staking platform racks up $2.3 million in presale with massive 167% APY
Investors can now stake GBTC tokens and leverage a revolutionary gamified green staking system. The platform introduces fresh challenges weekly, ensuring an engaging experience for participants.
Currently, the total GBTC token stake stands at 3.4 million, with 64% of GBTC already staked. Stakers enjoy an annual reward of 167%, contributing to a total reward pool of 1.1 million. The next price increase is anticipated in just four days, and the presale allows purchases with Ethereum, USDT, and credit cards.
Notably, the project has introduced BNB as an alternative payment method to address the high fees associated with Ethereum transactions. However, it’s essential to note that opting for purchases on the BNB network disqualifies one from the 167% annual return through staking.
Therefore, Ethereum emerges as the preferred choice for those aiming for the highest possible returns. Alternatively, for step-by-step instructions on acquiring $GBTC, please refer to our comprehensive guide.

"Bitcoin’s DeFi Protocol, STACKS (STX) Could Rally to $112: Analyst",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"
Ben Armstrong has predicted the potential targets for STACKS (STX), Bitcoin’s DeFi network.
According to Armstrong, STX could rally to $18, $50, or $112, depending on various factors.
Armstrong thinks STACKS would claim a significant portion of Bitcoin’s Layer-2 market but not dominate it.

Ben Armstrong, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, has predicted the potential targets for STACKS (STX), the Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) network. Armstrong provided three potential price targets, depending on how the crypto market develops and how STX copes with imminent challenges.
In a recently uploaded video, Armstrong predicted STX will rally to at least $18 in the most bearish case, with a market cap of $26 billion. He believes a bearish STX outlook will depend on Bitcoin maxis starting another “war” by attacking the project. Otherwise, Armstrong thinks STX has a good chance of rallying to $112, with a market cap of around $169 billion. According to him, that is possible if STACKS becomes the undisputed Layer-2 network for Bitcoin.
Besides the two extreme situations highlighted by Armstrong, he thinks there is a higher possibility of STX settling som…

Bitcoin Poised to Surge 138K in 18 Days Based on Historical Trends,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"The post Bitcoin Poised to Surge 138K in 18 Days Based on Historical Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Renowned crypto analyst Anthony Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, recently pointed to a historical pattern indicating that Bitcoin’s price might hit $138,000 in the next 18 days. With Bitcoin recently breaking its all-time high at $69,000, Pompliano suggests a potential doubling, drawing attention to a fascinating trend.
Bitcoin to Hit 138K
During a CNBC appearance, Pompliano highlights a noteworthy observation, suggesting that Bitcoin has doubled three out of the past four times it surpassed its all-time high.
Drawing parallels to historical occurrences, he suggests that the current surge could lead to a significant price spike, reaching $138,000.
Breaking an all-time high triggers what Pompliano calls a “price discovery” phase, where the market grapples with determining Bitcoin’s true value. This phase, marked by heightened interest and investment, could pave the way for substantial gains.
Caution Amid Optimism
Additionally, he clarified that he wasn’t predicting a precise price but highlighted Bitcoin’s historical trend of doubling within 18 days after breaking previous all-time highs. This, combined with the upcoming Bitcoin reward halving, hints at a possible substantial price surge.
Despite the caution that past performance doesn’t assure future results, Pompliano emphasizes the impact of the approaching halving and growing institutional interest.
Institutional Impact 
Recent data shows Bitcoin’s noteworthy growth, up over 15% in the past week and more than 60% in the last month.
Adding to the analysis, Austin Arnold attributed the recent surge to major players like BlackRock and the emergence of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have generated substantial demand. The market also expects a supply disturbance due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in about 40 days.
Bitcoin price Movement 
As of now, following the recent all-time high of $69,000, Bitcoin has retraced to around $67,300, representing a 0.75% increase for the day. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price movement has placed its market capitalization at $1.32 trillion. So far this year, Bitcoin has experienced a change of 59.33%.","['BASED', 'BTC', 'OP', 'BLACKROCK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ead133e9c9d311fbae63d1/
Is Bitcoin repeating its 2020 breakout? Here’s why $92.5K might be the next target,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) price looks ready to rally toward or above $90,000 in the coming weeks due to a mix of supportive technical, on-chain, and fundamental indicators.
BTC price bull pennant taking shape
BTC's price entered a phase of consolidation, moving sideways within a triangular formation resembling a bull pennant, after achieving a new all-time high of $69,210.

Notably, traditional analysts see bull pennants as bullish continuation patterns that could increase prices as much as the previous uptrend’s height. This breakout typically accompanies an increase in trading volume.
Bitcoin’s chances of a breakout are currently considerable as price consolidates, particularly after new all-time highs this week, and other reasons discussed below. Thus, the next target could be around $92,500 in the coming weeks, up 35% from the current levels.
Increasing Bitcoin ETF inflows
Bitcoin's price uptrend in recent weeks has coincided with the increasing capital inflows into the U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). Notably, these ETFs hold over $53 billion in their reserves as of March 7, compared to $27.95 billion at their launch in January.

Higher inflows into an ETF suggest that more investors are buying shares of the ETF, which, in turn, increases demand for the underlying assets. This is because the fund manager may need to purchase additional assets to ensure the ETF accurately reflects the index composition or sector it tracks.
“It appears that the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval launched an accumulation that, if sustained, puts BTC at $100K by October 2024,” market analyst Timothy Peterson commented on X.

Moreover, the increasing ETF inflows come weeks ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Historically, halving events have been associated with increases in the price before (and after) the mining reward is cut in half.  
2020 Bitcoin fractal hints at more gains ahead
Bitcoin’s current price action also closely resembles a historical fractal before its price rally toward $69,000 in November 2021, according to market analyst Jelle.

These similar drawdowns around all-time high prices suggest that the next leg up might be just around the corner like during the last bull cycle, albeit with some differences. 
""Bitcoin is acting similar to 2020's all-time high breakout,"" Jelle argues on X, adding:

 ""A failed breakout with sharp correction, then some consolidation, and a successful breakout higher.""

Should history repeat with a successful breakout higher, BTC price will be targeting prices north of $75,000.

Arizona Considers Adding Bitcoin ETFs to Retirement Funds,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Altcoin Buzz,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"The Arizona State Senate is reportedly considering a motion that would allow the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) and the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) to include Bitcoin ETFs in their investment portfolios. 
The state’s Senate first heard and read the Bitcoin retirement resolutions on January 30, 2024. The proposal suggests that the ASRS and PSPRS monitor the Bitcoin ETF market and weigh the implications of adding Bitcoin ETFs to retirement portfolios. This would entail speaking with companies that provide Bitcoin ETFs that have been approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Afterward, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and the State Treasurer of Arizona would receive a “comprehensive report” detailing the safety measures to be taken, as well as the feasibility, risks, and potential benefits of increasing exposure to Bitcoin ETFs.
Republican State Senator Wendy Rogers spearheaded the proposal. Rogers, in 2022, moved to have Bitcoin accepted as legal tender in the state. However, the bill never made it to a committee hearing.
US States Roll Out More Crypto-Friendly Policies
The Arizona State Senate’s action is in line with those of other states and localities that have begun to set aside cash for crypto investments. For example, in 2021, a Texas firefighter’s pension fund announced plans to invest $25 million in Bitcoin and Ether. Similarly, a retirement system in Virginia started making investments in cryptocurrency-related businesses as early as 2019.

As recently reported, Virginia is making moves to explore blockchain technology and improve local engagement. The state recently introduced a bill that encourages crypto activities. The Virginia House of Delegates approved historic Senate Bill No. 339, which supports cryptocurrencies, on March 4. The bill makes several recommendations, such as tax benefits for small investors and rewards for cryptocurrency miners.
The bill pushed for the creation of a specialized work group charged with researching cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and crypto mining. The goal of the initiative is to offer suggestions for developing and utilizing these technologies in Virginia. The state hopes to become a hotspot for innovation and cryptocurrency by luring high-growth tech and cryptocurrency enterprises with supportive policies from legislators. 
The bill also puts Virginia up against other states that embrace the use of cryptocurrencies. Wyoming, for example, recently exempted crypto companies from money transmission licenses. It also launched a Financial Technology Sandbox to promote innovation.

These efforts prove that the crypto industry is enjoying mainstream acceptance, which adds legitimacy to the industry.

Floki Coin Soars and Launches Major Ad Campaign in Times Square,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Floki Coin Soars and Launches Major Ad Campaign in Times Square
Popular memecoin Floki (FLOKI) has captured the crypto world’s attention with a significant price surge of over 40% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $0.00017100, having made a notable breakout from the $0.00016928 region earlier today. This breakout is particularly valuable as it indicates a significant upward momentum. The Floki team quickly responded to this price movement by announcing an ambitious advertising campaign to be held at one of the world’s most iconic locations, New York’s Times Square.
Details of Floki’s Advertising Campaign
The Floki team’s strategic move to showcase the project in Times Square is part of an effort to increase the altcoin’s visibility and presence in an increasingly competitive environment.
The announced advertising campaign will leverage Times Square’s iconic status as an advertising hub to attract a global audience. The campaign is set to start on March 15th and is planned to continue for three months, ensuring a constant and impactful presence in one of New York’s busiest hubs.

During Floki’s advertising campaign, a double-sided HD LED screen at Times Square Plaza will be used. Measuring 17 meters in width and 8.8 meters in height, this digital billboard will offer a vast canvas for Floki’s advertising campaign, reaching the multitude of people who flock to Times Square daily. Analysts and industry observers are closely monitoring the potential impact of this robust advertising campaign, drawing parallels with successful branding strategies observed in the crypto market.
Floki’s Times Square-centered advertising campaign has created great expectations among industry experts who foresee tangible results in terms of investor confidence. The crypto community is eagerly anticipating further developments, predicting potential price increases following this strategic marketing move.
TVL Reaches All-Time High
In addition to the advertising campaign, Floki has achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high total value locked (TVL) of $421.9 million in its Staking Program.
This success has positioned the altcoin among the leading memecoins in the crypto market by enhancing its utility value and long-term price stability.

Terra founder Do Kwon faces deportation to South Korea,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Terraform Labs co founder, Do Kwon’s legal challenges are taking a bit of extension. As the latest development unfolds, the Court of Appeals in Montenegro reportedly overturned a High Court decision to extradite Kwon to the United States A win for Do Kwon? 
According to reports, the justice minister of South Korea has stated that the country is waiting for Montenegro to extradite Do Kwon. However, this comes after reports indicated that a Montenegrin court overturned a decision to extradite the jailed crypto entrepreneur.
It is important to note that the decision instead favored Kwon’s deportation to his native South Korea. Faller Terra founder has also expressed a preference for being deported to his nation.
As reports surface, Park Sung-jae, S.Korea’s Justice Minister stated that the court has not yet officially notified his country about the decision. However, once an official notice comes out, the Justice Ministry will take the actions required to come in line with Montenegrin authorities.
The United States authorities had decided to stand their ground. They will continue to seek the extradition of Do Kwon despite a big decision from the Montenegrin court’s decision. The Justice Department highlighted its commitment to go after the deportation of Terra founder under international and bilateral agreements. What’s next? 
Alleged responsible for the 2022 crypto market collapse, Do Kwon had been a fugitive from South Korean charges before being arrested in Montenegro in March 2023. He is facing charges for traveling on a fake passport. These actions have led to his deportation appeal from both the US and S.Korea.
The latest decision can be considered a win for the Terra founder as he faces allegations linked to the horrible collapse of the $40 billion TerraUSD stablecoin. It seems like there is more chance of Kwon’s extradition to South Korea than the US. His lawyers have already preferred him to be extradited to South Korea. 
Meanwhile, there are some legal experts that have raised questions over the decision to send Kwon to his native nation instead of the United States. Concerns have been raised about potential outcomes and sentences in different jurisdictions.
As Do Kwon’s legal saga continues, the global crypto market registered a brief recovery on Friday morning. The cumulative crypto market cap jumped by more than 2% over the last day to stand at $2.56 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices saw a jump of around 2% and 4%, respectively.

"FLOKI Price Prediction: FLOKI Surges 48%, But Is Surpassed By This Relaunched Meme Coin That Soars To New All-Time High",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"The FLOKI price surged more than 48% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.000183 as of 2:20 a.m. EST as investors go long on the meme coin.
The FLOKI Price Breaks Resistance

4-hour chart for FLOKI/USDT (Source: TradingView)
The FLOKI price was able to break above the resistance level at $0.00016318 and is currently attempting to flip the level into support. This is after it printed a series of higher highs and higher lows on its 4-hour chart. Should it remain above this threshold within the next 12 hours, it may continue climbing in the short term. 
This bullish thesis could be invalidated if the FLOKI price breaks below the $0.00016318 mark in the next 8 hours. In this alternative scenario, the meme coin may be exposed to the risk of falling to the closest support level at $0.00013075. 
Before it can reach this point, it still has the lower boundary of the aforementioned price channel as a line of defense. However, breaking out below the channel may signal a bearish shift in the crypto’s momentum. 
As such, the FLOKI price could plummet to as low as $0.00009650 in the following few days should it fall out of the channel.
The FLOKI Price May Keep Rising As Technicals Align
There is a lot of technical strength present on FLOKI’s 4-hour chart, suggesting the crypto’s price may keep rising in the coming 48 hours. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recently crossed above the MACD Signal line. This specific technical occurrence is generally seen as a sign that a crypto has entered into a bullish cycle. With the MACD line breaking away above the MACD Signal line, the positive trend also seems to be growing stronger.
Buyers have the upper hand on FLOKI’s 4-hour chart as well, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) line is breaking away above its Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. Similar to the MACD and MACD Signal lines, the RSI is breaking away above the SMA line. This suggests that bulls are growing stronger as well.
Traders and investors will want to note that the RSI is around 69, which shows that FLOKI is overbought. Although this is normally seen as a sell signal, it is also not unusual for the RSI to remain this high for sustained periods of time when a crypto is pumping.
As impressive as FLOKI’s 24-hour gain is, it was overshadowed by the over 52% gain SPONGE printed during the same period.
A History Of Whopping Gains
SPONGE defied the odds when it posted 100x growth during the 2023 bear market, pushing its market cap to a peak of $100 million and rewarding early investors handsomely. 
The team behind the meme coin have now decided to give investors who missed out on the substantial gains recorded by SPONGE last year a second opportunity, with the launch of Sponge V2.

To increase the chances of a repeat of its prior success, the SPONGE team has introduced several new elements and features to the project’s ecosystem. Most notably is the migration from the Ethereum blockchain to the more scalable and cost-efficient Polygon network. 
There is also a play-to-earn racer game, which will come in both a paid and a free version. This brings a level of utility into the meme coin’s ecosystem, as the paid version will require players to top up their in-game credits with SPONGE. Players also stand the chance to earn rewards that are paid in the crypto.
Investors Anticipating Explosive Growth
More than $29.6 million has been staked and bridged on SPONGE’s official website, serving as a strong indication of how confident investors are in the potential for SPONGE’s price to skyrocket soon.

SPONGE can be bought using either USDT or ETH. Once purchased, the tokens can be staked for the 180% rewards being offered via the project’s taking program. 
If you are interested, buy soon because there are rumors the token will list on multiple top-tier exchanges imminently.

Optimism Foundation dumps $90m of OP tokens in private sale,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Optimism Foundation decided to sell 19.5 million OP tokens, which are part of its ‘original working budget of 30% of the initial OP token supply.’
Optimism Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees the development of ecosystem projects and infrastructure, revealed in a forum post on Mar. 7 that it has entered into a “private token sale” of approximately 19.5 million OP tokens worth around $89.5 million as of press time.



Starting today and over the coming days, there will be several transactions from Optimism controlled wallets totaling approximately 25M OP tokens. We’re sharing as a heads up to our community that these are planned transactions.— Optimism (@Optimism) March 7, 2024




While the organization refused to disclose the terms and purchaser due to the nature of the deal, it noted that the tokens “are subject to a two-year lockup.”

“During the lock-up, the purchaser will be able to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for participation in governance.”

The foundation announced that the transfers would be executed over the coming days, asserting that these transactions were all part of their planned initiatives. Despite this development, the price of OP tokens remained mainly unaffected at $4.59, showing a marginal increase of approximately 1% according to CoinMarketCap data at the time of reporting.
This isn’t the first time the foundation has engaged in a private sale as in September 2023 the project also sold 116 million OP tokens to seven private buyers. At the time, the Optimism Foundation also refused to provide extensive details about the sale.

Binance Backs Ethereum’s Latest Network Upgrade,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Binance Backs Ethereum’s Latest Network Upgrade
Binance, the top cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, has pledged support for Ethereum‘s upcoming Dencun upgrade. To facilitate this, the platform will halt deposits and withdrawals across various networks, including Ethereum and its associated layer two solutions. The suspension is scheduled to commence prior to the upgrade’s expected implementation on March 13th.
Operational Changes During the Upgrade
The trading giant will pause transactions starting at 16:25 local time, resuming them once they are assured of the network’s stable performance post-upgrade. The trading of network-native assets, however, will remain unaffected during this period. Binance has taken the onus to manage all technical preparations, ensuring a smooth transition for users.
The interruption of services is a precautionary measure, assuring that the update process on the Ethereum blockchain proceeds without issues. After the network stabilizes following the upgrade, Binance will promptly restore the deposit and withdrawal functions for affected networks.
Enhancements Brought by Dencun
The Dencun update, a blend of the terms “Deneb” and “Cancun,” signals a significant progression in Ethereum’s development path. It targets enhancements in the Consensus and Execution Layers, focusing on scalability, security, and efficiency. The update introduces Proto-Danksharding with EIP-4844 to decrease Layer 2 rollup costs through blob transactions, enabling more effective data handling and lessening storage burdens.
Additionally, it includes various other Ethereum Improvement Proposals. EIP-4788 improves cross-layer communication, EIP-6780 revamps the SELFDESTRUCT function for better smart contract security, and EIP-5656 optimizes smart contract memory operations. Further, the update refines Ethereum staking processes, with EIPs addressing voluntary exits and attestation inclusion, while promoting cost efficiency with new opcodes and smart contract execution improvements.

Soaring Polygon Usage Points to Rising Interest in MATIC,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Soaring Polygon Usage Points to Rising Interest in MATIC
Polygon’s MATIC has seen a dramatic increase in active addresses, signaling heightened interest that could be a precursor to a price surge. Over the past 30 days, active addresses have swelled by nearly 60%, correlating with a price hike from $0.83 to $1.14. Despite this uptick, there has been a recent plateau in activity, historically a sign of impending price stability or correction.
Growth in Active User Base
The surge in active users of the Polygon network is noteworthy, with the count of active MATIC addresses jumping from 10,439 to 15,708 within a month. This rise accompanied a robust 37.35% increase in its market price, though the digital asset has yet to revisit its April 2023 high of $1.14.
Trends and Price Movements
The price trajectory of MATIC is closely intertwined with Ethereum‘s, often reflecting a correlation coefficient above 0.8. Recently, this has intensified, with the correlation elevating from 0.5 to an impressive 0.95. Although MATIC’s price has not soared as dramatically as Ethereum’s in the past year, its strong correlation suggests potential for significant growth.
Given the tight linkage between MATIC and Ethereum, and with Ethereum’s price currently on an upward trajectory, expectations for MATIC’s performance are optimistic. While MATIC’s growth has lagged Ethereum’s, the historical pattern indicates that a catch-up in its valuation is plausible.
Despite the recent pause in activity, the rising user engagement and price correlation with Ethereum offer a promising outlook for MATIC. However, investors are reminded of the cyclical nature of the crypto market and the potential for both upward trends and corrections.

Metaverses could be a hub for distributing copyrighted work illegally — UK researchers,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"Researchers in the United Kingdom have studied the viability of current intellectual property (IP) laws and their application to new technologies like the metaverse. In the study, the researchers identified the shortcomings of existing laws and presented their recommendations. 
On March 7, the U.K. government published an externally commissioned research report titled “IP and Metaverse.” The report dove into the existing literature on IP laws and how they can apply to the metaverse. Within the study, the researchers concluded that there are metaverse-specific IP issues, such as IP governance in an interoperable environment and regulating technologies like the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within virtual worlds.
According to the report, many legal challenges come with interoperability, including the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted work. The researchers highlighted that the lack of interoperability has been important in preventing people from illegally distributing copyrighted material. With interoperability being a key feature in a metaverse, the researchers believe this could pose a challenge in governing the use and circulation of copyrighted work.
Meanwhile, blockchain’s inherent characteristics, such as immutability or being “tamper-proof,” also pose a challenge to enforcing IP laws. The researchers wrote: 

 “Blockchain’s inherent resistance to change or correction undermines the ability to flexibly manage or update IP rights. This is an issue which becomes especially worrisome in the context of ownership disputes, as well as for navigating the termination of agreements and rights if licensors or rightholders seek to leave the Metaverse.”

However, AI use in the potential metaverse governance of IP also poses some anticipated challenges. The researchers argued that algorithmic management of infringements is “extremely vulnerable to misuse” because of the absence of human oversight to guarantee the legitimacy of enforcement. 
Related: Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment
Apart from this, AI-generated content also brings up another challenge for IP enforcement in the metaverse. According to the study, reliance on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of inventorship in content. The research highlighted examples and cases that showed that “only works partially assisted by AI” are able to be protected by IP laws. 
Because of the anticipated issues in IP governance within the metaverse, the researchers concluded that there’s a need for clarity on a “plethora of key issues.” This includes legal issues on copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the metaverse. Because of this, the researchers believed that it’s necessary to formulate IP approaches for addressing governance and enforcement issues for a metaverse.

Polygon (MATIC) Gains Interest as Active Addresses Surge,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 02:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Polygon (MATIC) Gains Interest as Active Addresses Surge
The steady rise of active addresses and the momentum of Ethereum have been garnering interest for Polygon (MATIC). Does this indicate the beginning of a price surge, and if so, could we see it reach the $1.24 threshold?
Active Addresses on MATIC
Active MATIC addresses have grown by nearly 60% in the last 30 days. According to historical data, there is a strong correlation between the growth in active addresses and price. On February 6th, there were 10,439 active addresses recorded. This number rose to 15,708 by March 3rd. The price also increased from $0.83 to $1.14 during the same period, marking a 37.35% growth. MATIC has not touched the price level of $1.14 since April 2023.
Despite the significant increase in active addresses and prices over the past month, things have come to a standstill. Based on past data, a pause in the growth of active addresses often precedes a period of price stability or a potential price correction. The indicated pattern could suggest that the MATIC price might similarly undergo a consolidation phase or experience a downward correction in the near future.

MATIC Price Analysis
According to historical data, the MATIC price closely mirrors the price movements of ETH, often showing a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.8. This connection intensified particularly over the past month. The correlation rose from a modest 0.5 on February 1st to a striking 0.95 on March 6th. Given Ethereum‘s current upward momentum, this close correlation could indicate promising expectations for MATIC.
However, this could also steer MATIC towards the anticipated price target of $1.24. On the other hand, when examining the growth rates of both ETH and MATIC this year, a clear disparity emerges. Additionally, Ethereum’s price has increased 4.5 times more than that of MATIC. Considering the traditionally strong correlations, it would seem reasonable to predict that MATIC has the potential to rise.

Partnership between RAK DAO and Tencent Cloud to Empower Crypto Startups in UAE,COIN_MARKET_CAP,UNLOCK_ENG,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"Tencent Cloud, a division of the Chinese conglomerate Tencent offering cloud services, has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Arab Emirates’ specialized free economic zone focusing on cryptocurrencies. The aim is to support the growth of startups through various initiatives.
Announced on March 7 by Ras Al Khaimah Digital Asset Oasis (RAK DAO), the MoU with Tencent Cloud aims to explore avenues for mutual growth. Initially, the agreement involves fostering the development of startups registered within RAK DAO, a dedicated crypto zone situated in Ras Al Khaimah, one of the UAE’s emirates.
As part of the MoU, a Tencent Cloud training center will be established within RAK DAO to promote skill development and education. Additionally, internship opportunities will be provided for companies licensed in RAK DAO and its partners within the Tencent Cloud ecosystem.
Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, hailed the MoU signing as a significant achievement for the emirate, emphasizing the collaboration’s role in enhancing Ras Al Khaimah’s status as a technology hub.
Tencent Cloud CEO Dowson Tong expressed the collaboration’s objective of setting new standards in the Web3 space and unlocking fresh opportunities in the digital economy.
In the UAE, free-trade zones allow entrepreneurs to own 100% of their businesses, operating under distinct regulatory frameworks and tax schemes independent of the mainland, barring the country’s criminal law.
Launched in 2023, RAK DAO serves as a free-trade zone specifically catering to virtual asset companies, focusing on Web3 technologies such as the metaverse, blockchain, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

US DOJ appeals Montenegro court’s extradition verdict favoring Do Kwon’s return to South Korea,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"U.S. prosecutors have declared their intention to appeal a recent decision by a Montenegrin high court regarding the extradition of Do Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs, to South Korea.
The development is part of an ongoing legal saga involving multiple jurisdictions, including South Korea and the U.S., both of which have filed extradition requests for Kwon.
According to a report by Bloomberg on March 7, the Department of Justice (DOJ) of the U.S. is pursuing Kwon’s extradition in line with “relevant international and bilateral agreements and Montenegrin law.” The DOJ also expressed appreciation for the cooperation of Montenegrin authorities in adhering to the rule of law.
The legal battle over Kwon’s extradition reached a pivotal moment on Feb. 21, when the High Court in Podgorica ruled in favor of sending Kwon to the United States. However, this decision was overturned two weeks later by the Montenegro Appeals Court due to “significant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure.” This shift in the court’s stance realigns Kwon’s potential extradition path back toward South Korea.
The U.S. case against Kwon involves eight charges, including allegations of fraud and market manipulation related to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem. South Korea has also levied charges against Kwon, including fraud and violations of capital markets law. Kwon’s legal team has expressed a preference for his extradition to South Korea, citing proximity to his family and a potential 40-year prison sentence.

This legal development coincides with another high-profile case in the United States involving Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of FTX, who faces potentially decades in prison following a fraud conviction in New York. The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, which is also pursuing charges against Kwon, prosecuted Bankman-Fried.
Kwon was apprehended in March 2023 by Montenegrin authorities for traveling with a counterfeit Costa Rican passport, following an arrest warrant issued by South Korean prosecutors in September 2022. Since his arrest, Kwon has spent time in prison over the passport incident and was later transferred to extradition custody.
In related news, the Terra Classic community is actively working on initiatives to recover from the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022. Efforts include implementing token-burning mechanisms to reduce the overall supply of LUNC and discussing potential rebranding strategies. These measures aim to restore investor confidence and differentiate the project from its troubled past.
Additionally, the community is exploring integrations with new projects and decentralized applications to broaden LUNC’s utility and encourage adoption within the web3 ecosystem.
Despite these efforts, the fallout from the TerraUSD crash continues to pose regulatory challenges for LUNC, impacting its credibility in the financial market.

Binance Announces Support for Ethereum’s Dencun Update,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Binance Announces Support for Ethereum’s Dencun Update
The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, announced its support for the Ethereum‘s (ETH) Dencun update. In line with this, the cryptocurrency exchange will temporarily suspend deposit and withdrawal transactions for various networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and others.
Supporting the Dencun Update
Cryptocurrency exchange Binance will support the Dencun update for Ethereum, which is expected to occur on March 13th at around 16:55 local time. As part of the update support, Binance will temporarily suspend deposit and withdrawal transactions for various networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Base Protocol (BASE), Manta Network (MANTA), Starknet (STRK), and Polygon (MATIC).

This suspension will begin around 16:25 local time on the same day and will continue until the update is completed and confirmed to be problem-free on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, trading operations for the native assets of the networks whose deposit and withdrawal transactions will be suspended before and during the update will continue without any restrictions.
Binance assures its users that all technical requirements and adjustments necessary for the update will be handled by the exchange itself.
Once the Ethereum network is deemed stable and operational after the update, Binance will resume deposit and withdrawal transactions for all affected networks.
What is the Dencun Update?
Named after a combination of the words “Deneb” and “Cancun,” the Dencun update represents a significant milestone in the ongoing development of the Ethereum network. The update, targeting both the Consensus Layer (CL) and the Execution Layer (EL), brings a series of improvements aimed at enhancing Ethereum’s scalability, security, and overall network efficiency.
At the heart of the Dencun update is Proto-Danksharding, introduced with EIP-4844. This feature aims to significantly reduce Layer 2 (L2) rollup costs by introducing blob transactions. The blobs, or binary large objects, enable efficient off-chain data packet processing, thus increasing the network’s data efficiency and reducing storage load.
The update also includes various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) such as EIP-4788, which bridges the communication gap between Ethereum’s execution and consensus layers, and EIP-6780, which revises the use of the SELFDESTRUCT function to increase smart contract security. Another notable innovation with Dencun is EIP-5656, which introduces a new opcode for more efficient memory copying in smart contracts.
Dencun also aims to improve the staking experience on Ethereum. EIPs such as EIP-7044 and EIP-7045 address voluntary exits and attestation inclusion, respectively, facilitating a smoother and more flexible staking process. The update promises enhanced cost efficiency through EIPs like EIP-5656 and EIP-1153, which offer optimized smart contract execution and new opcodes for transient storage.

7 investment principles for newcomers丨blockchain,COIN_MARKET_CAP,SuperEx,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"One day in a coin circle, one year on earth. In the face of this 24-hour market, the digital currency world with 10% fluctuation is sideways. If you want to make money, you can’t play with traditional investment skills.Just like a bitcoin player on Twitter, he made such a mockery of Wall Street traders:“You, a Wall Street trader, have worked 100 hours a week for 10 years and have no time to spend with your family. You are super excited about the 10% return this year; I, a bitcoin player, get a 900% return by reading, watering and eating steak every day. ”Click to register SuperExClick to download the SuperEx APPClick to enter SuperEx CMCClick to enter SuperEx DAO Academy — SpaceHigh return means high risk? The encryption market has got rid of this theorem, not to mention the return of hundreds of thousands of times when investing in btc in 2010. Even if you enter the market with 300U on January 1, 2017 and buy 100 yuan each in the Top20 currencies, the return on January 1, 2018 is 6358%, and finally it becomes 127160, which is 300 times better than Wall Street.Not to mention the subsequent MEME track and the inscription track in the past two years, which can realize the market of wealth freedom with an investment of 100U!Crazy? Crazy! But don’t be too arrogant. Some people in the market will lose money. As a newcomer, you must keep in mind the following seven principles! Great help to you!Principle 1: Establish your own reliable information source.The market of encryption market is rolling around the clock for 24 hours, and new tracks and new concepts are surging like a flood. In this era of information explosion, you can receive hundreds of thousands of messages every day. As a newcomer, distinguishing the true and false news is the first lesson!The news is still fake? Of course, some unscrupulous project parties publish false news just to lure you in!It is a good way to join various forums and track industry opinion leaders, and track the social accounts of the founders and teams of major cryptocurrencies. At the same time, digital currency has become a global thing, so you should learn to find a way out of the limitations of your own country and language, and go to the oil pipeline, Twitter, and even Japanese and Korean forums to see what is really happening.Principle 2: Basic skills should be solid.Some people say that in the workplace, what is the most basic element of promotion and salary increase if you want to do a good job? Learn professional knowledge and employee handbook!The same is true for the encryption market. You must first lay a solid knowledge foundation and figure out the relationship between blockchain and bitcoin, what is the difference between 1.0 and 2.0, and what are the characteristics and shortcomings of this social mechanism. Of course, you have to learn some basic knowledge of economics.With the knowledge base, you will know which news violates the basic economic operation law, and this kind of news is false news. For example: when the tokens of a certain project are being smashed in large quantities, the project party writes an article saying that it is the bottom of the price and a good time to enter! Is this news true or false?Principle 3: Don’t be superstitious about any big V, think independently and analyze rationally.You can learn knowledge and master information from the big V or KOL, but please don’t be superstitious about any big V, you should have your own independent thinking ability, and don’t chase after it without logical verification just because a big V you are concerned about says that this coin is good, which is often tragic.Sometimes it’s not because of the malicious intention of big V or big boss to cut leeks, but because the currency circle is changing all the time, and no one can grasp all the information or have enough energy to control the direction of the whole market. Therefore, we must not only learn from the big brothers, but more importantly, fear the market.Principle 4: Reduce the quantity and bet on the key points.Many people like to diversify their investments. Although diversification is a good investment method, it can only keep wealth, but not accumulate wealth.Indeed, if you know that your investment is scattered in 15–20 projects, even if one of them dies, it will not have much impact on your portfolio, and you can still sleep well at night.But it is difficult to achieve wealth growth. For example, if you like 25 projects, you just need to make some high-return big bets on the top 6–7 projects that you think are the most promising. It is much easier to manage 6–7 parts than 25 parts.Principle 5: Write down your investment argument.It seems boring, and it’s not something that many people will do. But as Louis Cooper said in the following tweet, writing can help you build your investment belief.It can also help you better understand your investment targets and find out the shortcomings in your knowledge. In addition, it is easier to avoid investing because of FOMO by forcing yourself to write analysis articles before buying tokens.Principle 6: Don’t ALL IN, no leverage.This is not much to describe. No ALL IN can improve your investment fault tolerance rate and give you a chance to come back. Leverage is an area that novices are forbidden to touch. Please note that it is forbidden for novices to touch, not to say that leverage should never be touched!Principle 7: Review your portfolio every 1–2 months.Unless you buy BTC or ETH, these two coins are head-stable, and short-term fluctuations will not be particularly crazy. If not, please review your investment regularly, and the ideal period is 1–2 months.The reason is very simple. Cryptographic currency is developing very fast, and most projects disappeared less than two years after its launch.Therefore, I suggest that they be reviewed regularly.Here are some things to pay attention to during inspection:· Recent progress of the team· Indicators on the chain: income, expenses, TVL, etc.· Community strength: Does anyone talk about the project on X? Is the number of people with consensus increasing or decreasing?· Roadmap: What is the next step of your investment project?As George Soros said:“What matters is not whether you are right or wrong, but how much money you earned when you were right and how much you lost when you were wrong. 」The only way to minimize the loss is to cut the meat early when the fundamentals change.It’s hard to accumulate wealth, but it’s easy to lose it. If you read this, please go back and study it again carefully!",['BTC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eac83d2070793d42b9efdb/

Solana (SOL) Whale Joins Bonk (BONK) Rival Cryptocurrency Priced $0.0014,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"A new development has caught the eye of the crypto community. Shiba Budz (BUDZ), a nascent cryptocurrency project, has emerged as a formidable rival to Bonk (BONK), the meme coin that has been the subject of much fascination and fervor within the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. 
Notably, a prominent Solana (SOL) whale, traditionally known for significant holdings in SOL, has made a substantial move into Shiba Budz (BUDZ), priced at an inviting $0.0014. This pivot comes at a time when the meteoric pump of Bonk (BONK) appears to be decelerating, prompting investors to scout for new opportunities.



The Solana (SOL) Connection
Solana (SOL) has been celebrated for its high throughput and low transaction costs, qualities that have endeared it to both developers and investors alike. The blockchain’s capability to support a vibrant ecosystem of projects, including the likes of Bonk (BONK), has solidified its position in the crypto market. However, the recent shift in interest from a noted Solana (SOL) whale towards Shiba Budz (BUDZ) underscores a broader trend of diversification and exploration of emerging tokens with potential for high returns.
Bonk (BONK)’s Phenomenal Rise
Bonk (BONK) captured headlines with its extraordinary pump, driven by a combination of speculative trading and genuine enthusiasm within the Solana (SOL) community. As a project built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, Bonk (BONK) benefited immensely from the network’s efficiency and scalability, traits that facilitated its rapid circulation and adoption. However, as with many crypto phenomena, the intensity of Bonk (BONK)’s initial surge has begun to moderate, leading investors to seek out the next big hit.
Shiba Budz (BUDZ): A New Challenger
Into this searching gaze of the market steps Shiba Budz (BUDZ), priced at $0.0014, a token that not only offers itself as a new vessel for investment but also as a rival to Bonk (BONK)’s dominance. The interest from a significant Solana (SOL) whale in Shiba Budz (BUDZ) is particularly noteworthy, signaling confidence in the project’s prospects and its potential to carve out a niche within the crypto space. 



This move has sparked a wave of attention towards Shiba Budz (BUDZ), with both Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK) investors keenly watching its progress.
Why Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK) Investors are Taking Note
The entry of a Solana (SOL) whale into the Shiba Budz (BUDZ) market is more than just a personal investment decision; it’s a bellwether for where savvy money sees opportunity. Solana (SOL) enthusiasts, drawn to the blockchain for its technological prowess, and Bonk (BONK) investors, attracted by the meme coin’s culture and community, are both finding common ground in their interest in Shiba Budz (BUDZ). 
The rationale is clear: Shiba Budz (BUDZ) not only promises the novelty and potential virality akin to Bonk (BONK) but also stands on the threshold of tapping into the robust Solana (SOL) network’s features.



The Strategic Significance of Shiba Budz (BUDZ) Pricing
Priced at a modest $0.0014, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) strategically positions itself as an accessible investment, echoing the early days of Bonk (BONK) and even Solana (SOL) itself. This pricing strategy is designed to attract a broad base of investors, from those looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities, to more conservative participants drawn to the potential for steady growth. The Solana (SOL) whale’s investment in Shiba Budz (BUDZ) adds an additional layer of intrigue, suggesting that beyond the attractive price point, there lies substantial confidence in its long-term value proposition.
Looking Forward: Solana (SOL), Bonk (BONK), and Shiba Budz (BUDZ)
The movements of Solana (SOL) whales and the shifting dynamics around projects like Bonk (BONK) serve as critical indicators of where the industry is headed. Shiba Budz (BUDZ) emerges at a pivotal moment, offering a new opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and engage with a fresh and promising project. The backing of Shiba Budz (BUDZ) by a significant Solana (SOL) whale is not just a testament to the project’s potential but also highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem, where the success of one token can have ripple effects on others.

Binance faces criticism for ‘Crypto’ perfume launch around international women’s day,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"Binance is facing major backlash online as users decry its use of a perfume to market to women as a sexist attempt to appeal to women by playing into female stereotypes.
It’s not unusual for major cryptocurrency companies like Binance to launch non-crypto accessories to cash in on the market’s enthusiasm, whether it’s Bitcoin t-shirts, meme coin-themed phone covers, or NFT-themed sunglasses. However, Binance made a very unique move yesterday, becoming the industry’s first company to launch a women’s fragrance called “CRYPTO.” 



Dear @binance this is not going how you planned in the commentsHere is some advice, if you want more women in crypto try posting some of your available job roles and let people know you are trying to increase diversity by hiring some more women, then HIRE MORE WOMEN.— NFTignition 🍌 (@NFTignition) March 6, 2024




Binance is promoting the perfume ahead of International Women’s Day to motivate women to participate actively in the crypto space. 
Despite ongoing demands for change, disparities in gender representation in the tech industry remain stark. In 2022, while women constituted 49% of the overall US workforce, they filled only 26% of positions in computing and technology sectors, as reported by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) in their annual State of the Tech report.
After the post, responses soon began pouring in online from people criticizing Binance for the apparent sexist blunder.

BlackRock wants to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs for global allocation fund,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers in the world, is planning to buy spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for its Global Allocation Fund (MALOX).
According to a March 7 update to the filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock wants to include physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), or in other words, spot Bitcoin ETFs, as part of MALOX.
The updated filing notes that MALOX may purchase BlackRock’s own spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as well as ETFs by other issuers, stating:

 “The fund may acquire shares in ETPs that seek to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin by directly holding bitcoin — ‘Bitcoin ETPs’ — including shares of a Bitcoin ETP sponsored by an affiliate of BlackRock.”

The fund will only invest in Bitcoin ETPs that are listed and traded on national securities exchanges, the filing noted.
Launched in 1989, the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund seeks to provide investment return through a fully managed investment policy utilizing U.S. and foreign equity, debt and money market securities, including companies like Microsoft, Apple and others. As of March 7, MALOX had $17.8 billion in assets under management.
MALOX is not the only BlackRock fund that the company wants to hold spot Bitcoin ETFs. The updated SEC filing comes just a few days after BlackRock submitted a similar filing update for its Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX) on March 4.
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, debuted trading on Jan. 11, alongside nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.

IBIT has emerged as the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin ETF, multiplying its BTC holdings by more than 7,000%, from 2,621 BTC on Jan. 11 to 187,531 BTC as of March 7, 2024. At the time of writing, IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings are worth $12.6 billion.
In addition to the spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has been actively pushing for a spot Ether (ETH) ETF with U.S. regulators. In November 2023, BlackRock filed a Form S-1 application for its iShares Ethereum Trust with Delaware’s Division of Corporations.
Industry analysts and observers have been arguing whether U.S. financial watchdogs would approve the launch of a spot ETH ETF in 2024. For Bitcoin, it took more than 10 years for the SEC to back a spot ETF in the United States.

"Crypto exchange Gemini planned public debute via Genesis merger, court documents show",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"Winklevoss’ crypto exchange Gemini was exploring an option to merge with crypto broker Genesis to compete with Coinbase and FTX.
In October 2022, just a month before FTX filed for bankruptcy, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss discussed at a lunch with Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert an idea of a closer partnership between the two companies that would make the joint entity a “juggernaut” to compete with Coinbase and FTX.
According to recently revealed court filings, Cameron Winklevoss was “intrigued about the idea of a closer partnership between Genesis/Gemini/DCG, including a potential merger of the companies,” Silbert wrote in an email to other DCG executives.
Silbert, according to the email, also warned Winklevoss at lunch about a possible bankruptcy of Genesis, which in turn, would put the exchange’s deposits at “significant risk.” Despite the warning, Cameron Winklevoss decided to continue to work with Genesis “to mitigate that risk.”

“I put him on clear notice that the path we’re on right now could lead to a Genesis bankruptcy, which would put Gemini’s deposits (and therefore, Gemini’s business) at significant risk. He took that part surprisingly well and appreciates we need to work together to mitigate that risk.”
Barry Silbert

According to disclosed correspondence, the combined company “would be super exciting to investors,” as it could go raise between $500 million up to $1 billion and take the company public “in 24 months.” Moreover, the joined entity would also make an opportunity to “acquire and roll up weak competitors,” Silbert noted.
Barry Silbert, who resigned as Grayscale chairman in late December 2023, allegedly was also mulling the idea of transferring Grayscale’s assets to Gemini, thereby making the exchange the “largest custody provider in the world.” Silbert also emphasized the combined entity “could use Coin Desk for customer lead gen.”

The trajectory of Genesis took a downturn when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early 2023, following FTX’s collapse. Subsequently, Gemini initiated legal action against Genesis in late October 2023, seeking ownership of approximately 60 million GTBC shares that Genesis had offered as collateral.
Both Gemini and Genesis faced legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for unlawful securities sales through the Earn program. Additionally, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil lawsuit totaling $1 billion against Gemini, Genesis, and DCG, alleging their involvement in defrauding American investors. Later, James escalated the demand for restitution to $3 billion.

Cryptocurrency analyst Juan Leon from Bitwise suggests that Ethereum (ETH) is on the cusp of a significant price rally that could see its value double to surpass $8,000 or even reach $10,000 in 2024. Despite Bitcoin‘s dominance in the news, Ethereum’s upcoming updates and the prospect of spot ETFs in the US have set the stage for potential growth.
Ethereum’s Upcoming Upgrades May Propel Price Increase
Ethereum’s anticipated Dencun update, scheduled for this month, is expected to cut costs for Layer 2 network transactions, boosting network efficiency and attracting consumer interest. Alongside the technical upgrade, the potential launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US adds to the momentum, with the SEC slated to review these ETFs in May. Leon assigns a 50-60% probability to their approval, positing that it’s a question of when, not if, they will be greenlit.
The introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs could mirror the success of Bitcoin ETFs which garnered $9 billion in net inflows, appealing to a conservative, institutional investor base. This shift could drive significant demand for Ethereum, further fueling its price growth.
Supporting Views and Market Trends
Bernstein, a notable brokerage firm, echoes Leon’s bullish sentiment on Ethereum, citing factors such as deflationary supply, a staking boom, and increased DeFi activity. Ethereum traditionally trails Bitcoin in reaching peak prices, but tends to follow in a robust rally once Bitcoin has set new highs. With Ethereum already seeing a 3.41% rise in 24 hours to $3,900 and outperforming Bitcoin’s 1.72% gain, the stage is being set for its ascent.
Ethereum’s potential growth is buoyed by historical patterns in the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin leads in recovery, with Ethereum and other altcoins following suit. As Bitcoin approaches its all-time high, Ethereum is expected to witness a months-long rally reaching new records.

SEC Postpones Verdict on Bitcoin ETF Options Trading,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: SEC Postpones Verdict on Bitcoin ETF Options Trading
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to extend the timeframe for ruling on the introduction of options tied to spot Bitcoin ETFs. This move is seen as a potential gateway for increased institutional investment into Bitcoin. The SEC has stretched the initial 45-day decision period to April 24, granting itself an extra 45 days. This prolongation follows the applications by Cboe Exchange and Miami International Securities Exchange to offer Bitcoin ETF options, which were filed on January 25.
Extended Analysis Period for Bitcoin ETF Options
The SEC is also taking more time to consider a similar proposal from the iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Nasdaq, overseen by financial giant BlackRock. The additional review period ensures a thorough examination of the requests. With the legal maximum for a decision being 90 days, the additional period brings the SEC closer to this deadline. Options provide investors with leverage, enabling them to bet on the price direction of the underlying assets.
Options trading in Bitcoin allows investors to speculate on price movements. By purchasing a call option, an investor could secure the right to buy Bitcoin at today’s price in the future, potentially profiting if the price increases. Conversely, if the price drops, the investor may let the option expire, forfeiting only the premium paid.
Market Dynamics and Regulatory Review
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has advocated for the approval of Bitcoin ETF options, suggesting they foster market health and vigor. Spot Bitcoin ETFs received regulatory consent to commence trading starting January 11, after protracted delays. The investment in ETF funds persists, with substantial assets managed by various funds as reported by BitMEX Research. The SEC’s decisions on several Ethereum ETF fund proposals are also pending, with predictions hinting at a potential May 23 deadline for a collective approval, coinciding with the VanEck application deadline.

Analysts Stunned as BlockDAG’s Presale Raises $3M in Record Time – Meet The Kaspa-Killer That’s Overshadowing Mina (MINA) ,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BlockchainReporter,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"In a turn of events that left industry analysts wide-eyed, BlockDAG’s presale astonishingly amassed $3 million in what can only be described as record-shattering time. This remarkable achievement not only positions BlockDAG as a formidable force but also raises the question: How did this so-called Kaspa-Killer manage to eclipse Mina (MINA)?BlockDAG’s presale is causing a seismic stir amongst analysts, with an astonishing $3M raked in – a clear testament to market confidence. This money-spinner has riveted even those traditionally cautious around cryptocurrency, catapulting the conversation about blockchain technology and inclusivity to new heights. Stay tuned to grasp the full implications of this turning point and its ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape.Kaspa Listing: What Lies Ahead for This Crypto?Kaspa (KAS) is a cryptocurrency designed for optimal decentralisation, security, and efficiency. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure for high scalability, enabling virtually unlimited transactions per second at low costs. This design supports widespread use, including smart contracts and daily transactions. Kaspa has also seen some exciting developments. HTX announced the Kaspa listing (KAS/USDT) perpetual futures, exhibiting the DeFi market’s growing diversity.Kaspa’s robust technology and unique inflationary token model showcase its ambition to become a key player in the crypto market, offering a solution that balances speed, cost, and environmental sustainability with a focus on becoming a part of everyday digital financial transactions.Tracking the Mina (MINA) Price: From $0.25 to $1.29Mina (MINA), dubbed the world’s smallest blockchain, began its journey in 2018 at $0.25 and now stands at $1.29. As it edges closer to its mainnet launch after extensive testnet trials, the Mina (MINA) price has shown volatility in early 2024, swinging between $1.15 and $1.68. Following a dip to around $1.00 in late January, the price has stabilised, currently fluctuating between $1.13 and $1.32, hinting at a possible breakout or further adjustments soon.The Kaspa Killer: Unraveling BlockDAG’s AllureBlockDAG (BDAG) is rapidly emerging as the market’s top-rated cryptocurrency, igniting investors’ excitement with its potential for staggering returns. Currently in its presale’s early batches, BlockDAG has impressively secured $3 million, setting its sights on surpassing 5000% in returns. Market analysts attribute this enthusiasm to several key factors: BlockDAG’s diverse income streams, pioneering position, formidable mining prowess, and favourable market conditions.Earning the moniker ‘Kaspa Killer,’ BlockDAG shines as a prime investment choice, particularly among early backers who have already seen a 50% uptick in their initial investments. This momentum underscores BlockDAG’s growing relevance and projected surge to $600 million by 2024. Investors from the second to the forty-fifth presale batch are eyeing up to 5000X returns, targeting a coin price of $0.05. This positions BlockDAG as an icon of hope in the fast-growing crypto market.As anticipation builds for the 2024 bull market, attention is shifting towards BlockDAG’s rivals. However, BlockDAG’s unique consensus mechanism and its significant profit potential have drawn in users, especially following the successful second batch of its presale. With these factors in play, BlockDAG is poised to be the market’s top-rated cryptocurrency, offering unmatched investment opportunities in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.Final Thought: BlockDAG Dubbed “Kaspa Killer”As the initial excitement surrounding HTX’s Kaspa listing and the recent Mina (MINA) price fluctuations gradually subside, the cryptocurrency community’s attention has shifted towards BlockDAG’s presale. This presale has indeed astounded analysts by successfully raising an impressive $3 million so far, which is a remarkable achievement in itself.This achievement not only showcases the market’s confidence in BlockDAG but also portrays it as the Kasper Killer, sparking meaningful discussions about the potential of blockchain technology and the importance of inclusivity within the industry.Invest In BlockDAG TodayWebsite: https://blockdag.networkPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.networkTelegram:https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficialDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu","['MINA', 'KAS']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eac73e2070793d42b9efd5/

Memecoin Floki launches a three-month Times Square takeover.
Floki dominates a 1,624 sq ft LED screen in Times Square.
Times Square Plaza hosts Floki’s strategic marketing blitz in NYC.

In an assertive move, Floki, the popular memecoin, is reclaiming the spotlight in the heart of New York with an extensive marketing campaign in Times Square Plaza. This development is following FLOKI price surge of over 300% last week.



FLOKI TAKES OVER THE HEART OF NEW YORK#Floki is back in the mainstream of New York with an aggressive marketing campaign: Times Square Plaza!Starting March 15th and running for a full THREE MONTHS, Floki will be prominently displayed in the historic and unforgettable Times… pic.twitter.com/opgzCVcrMn— FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) March 7, 2024




Commencing on March 15th and spanning a remarkable three months, Floki will be showcased on a colossal double-sided HD LED screen, strategically positioned beside the Nasdaq billboard in Times Square.
The impressive digital billboard, measuring 56 feet wide by 29 feet high and located five stories above the intersection at 1500 Broadway and West 43rd Street, covers a staggering 1,624 square feet of viewing space, surpassing the size of the average Manhattan home.
Notably placed in the core of Times Square Plaza, recognized as ‘The Gateway to New York,’ the 1500 Broadway Spectacular is set to display Floki’s captivating ten-second advertisement at least four times per hour, airing for 20 hours each day, throughout the 93-day campaign. This extensive coverage equates to a minimum of 7,440 ten-second spots, ensuring Floki’s presence.
Times Square, a daily hub for 330,000 visitors and an annual thoroughfare for 50 million people, solidifies its status as the busiest attraction in the United States. The strategic placement of Floki’s campaign in this iconic location aligns with the coin’s mission to capture the attention of a vast audience.
As Floki takes center stage in Times Square, it further cements its association with memecoins in the crypto sphere. The move is anticipated to coincide with what some believe will be the most explosive bull run in the history of cryptocurrency, underscoring Floki’s determination to stay at the forefront of the industry.
With the FLOKI big token of 190.9 billion FLOKI tokens set for a burn later this week, the entire crypto community is keeping a close watch on the FLOKI price chart. Is the memecoin set for another seismic price surge?

SEC Postpones BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Decision,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"

  Cover image via U.Today


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the extension of its review period for the proposed rule change by Nasdaq ISE, LLC to list and trade options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust. 
Initially filed on Jan. 9, the proposal aimed to introduce options trading for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, a move that has attracted attention and commentary within the financial and cryptocurrency communities.
Extended review period
The SEC's decision to delay its ruling comes after the initial 45-day review period following the proposal's publication.
This extension allows the SEC until Apr. 24, to either approve, disapprove, or proceed with further examination of the proposed rule change. 
This move indicates the SEC's need for additional time to thoroughly consider the implications and public feedback, of which it has received five comments. 
Grayscale's legal challenge
In a related narrative, Grayscale Investments has signaled potential legal action against the SEC following the denial of options trading for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). 
Grayscale has been vocal in seeking parity with other financial products, emphasizing that the SEC's rejection constitutes unfair treatment to its investors and limits the product's attractiveness. 
The firm argues that the SEC's earlier approval of options trading for bitcoin futures ETFs sets a precedent that should be extended to GBTC, advocating for the benefits of options trading in enhancing price discovery, market navigation, and investment hedging.","['SEC', 'ETF', 'BTC', 'APRIL', 'GBTC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eac6a9e9c9d311fbae63b4/
Key Cardano Priorities for March 2024 Co-Signed by ADA Creator,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"

  Cover image via U.Today


In a recent article penned by prominent Cardano contributor Rick McCracken, three pivotal priorities for the ADA community in March 2024 have been underscored, with a co-signature from Charles Hoskinson himself amplifying their significance.
McCracken's insights shed light on critical areas demanding attention from Cardano enthusiasts and stakeholders. Foremost among these is the imperative to update pools to the latest 8.7.3 full P2P version. With a substantial 68% of reporting SPOs already onboard, this patch release addresses a bug in the outbound-governor, fortifying the network against potential vulnerabilities.

https://t.co/iuwTrQvme7— Rick McCracken DIGI (@RichardMcCrackn) March 8, 2024

Another focal point highlighted by McCracken is the deployment of Mithril, a protocol vital for bolstering Cardano's defense mechanisms against potential attacks. Presently, only 15% of staked ADA are utilizing this essential feature, with a desired uptake of 60% deemed necessary for robust network security.
Furthermore, McCracken emphasizes the imminent necessity of stress-testing SanchoNet, the testnet geared toward rolling out groundbreaking governance features for the Cardano blockchain. With 23 DReps and 29 stake pools currently engaged, the anticipated Chang HFC event in three months underscores the urgency for rigorous stress and battle testing in the coming months.
Charles Hoskinson, cofounder of Cardano, has lent his weight to McCracken's clarion call by sharing the article on his social media platforms. This joint endorsement underscores the gravity of the outlined priorities, signaling a unified commitment to fortifying Cardano's infrastructure and ensuring its resilience in the face of evolving challenges.","['ADA', '2024', '2024', 'P2P']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eac6a99e5b5547d0d02a9f/
XRP Price Set to End the Week Lower as Investors Withdraw Profits of Almost $370 Million,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"The post XRP Price Set to End the Week Lower as Investors Withdraw Profits of Almost $370 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Ripple’s XRP has experienced a recent price dip, sliding to $0.62 on Friday. Despite this, the digital asset has managed to hold above the psychologically significant $0.60 level, demonstrating resilience in the face of profit-taking activities by holders. 
As the cryptocurrency market fluctuates, a critical deadline looms in the ongoing SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, adding another layer of complexity to XRP’s trajectory. 
Impending Lawsuit Deadline & Profit-taking activity 
The SEC had previously filed for a nine-day extension from March 13 to March 22, with impending remedies yet to be decided as the SEC needs to file its opening brief. 
Meanwhile, the altcoin has witnessed heightened on-chain activity, marked by an increase in Active Addresses and Whale transactions valued at $100,000 and higher.
XRP holders have seized an estimated $370 million in profits within the past week, spanning the beginning of March 2024. On-chain data from Santiment reveals a consistent profit throughout March, coinciding with XRP’s ascent to a peak of $0.6685. 
The altcoin’s ability to flip the $0.66 level from resistance to support could pave the way for a rally towards its December 2023 peak of $0.70. 
Indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) hint at a potential sweep of support at $0.57 before a recovery phase.
A critical determinant for the short-term trajectory lies in a daily candlestick close above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.62. Such a development could invalidate the thesis of a support sweep, opening the possibility for XRP to rally toward its December 2023 high.
In short, technical analysis suggests that XRP may encounter further downside, potentially testing the $0.57 level, representing the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally to its 2024 high of $0.6685. ","['2024', '2024', 'SEC', 'MM', 'XRP']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eac4322070793d42b9efcf/
SEC Delays Decision on Bitcoin ETF Options,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: SEC Delays Decision on Bitcoin ETF Options
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its decision on whether to approve option products in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This step could open the door for more institutional capital to flow into Bitcoin. On March 6, the SEC extended the deadline to respond to proposals from the Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange to offer options in Bitcoin ETF funds.
Noteworthy Development from the SEC
The SEC also delayed its decision on a proposal to offer options for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) traded on the Nasdaq, which is managed by BlackRock. This delay ensures that the agency has sufficient time to review the request. All exchanges applied on January 25 to list Bitcoin ETF options, and the SEC, which initially had 45 days to make a decision or delay, faced the first decision deadline on March 10.
The SEC has until April 24 to reach a final decision, which gives the agency an additional 45 days. By law, there is a maximum decision period of 90 days. Options are derivative products that provide leverage to investors and allow them to make directional trades in the market.

If an investor believes that the price of Bitcoin will rise, they can buy a call option by paying a premium and agree to buy 1 Bitcoin at today’s price one month later with less money than it would take to buy 1 Bitcoin outright. If Bitcoin rises within the month, the investor can exercise the option, purchase Bitcoin at a lower price, and potentially sell it for a profit. If Bitcoin falls, they will likely let the contract expire and lose the premium paid.
The SEC and ETF Process
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein called last month for the approval of options for Bitcoin ETF funds, claiming they contribute to a robust and healthy market. The SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF funds to start trading on January 11. This came after months of delays, on the last day a decision on approval was due.
Investors continue to invest in ETF funds. As of March 6, according to BitMEX Research, excluding Grayscale’s converted ETF, there were assets under management worth $25.87 billion in nine new ETF funds. The SEC is now faced with making a decision on seven spot Ethereum ETF funds. Analysts predict the agency may wait until May 23 to approve all of them, which is the deadline for VanEck’s application.

In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has dominated headlines in recent months, but according to Juan Leon, a crypto research analyst at asset management firm Bitwise, Ethereum (ETH) could be ready for significant growth by 2024. Leon suggests that ETH’s price could double from its current levels and potentially exceed $8,000 or even $10,000 this year.
Two Catalysts That Could Boost Ethereum’s Price
While Bitcoin has attracted attention with the launch of spot ETFs in the US, Ethereum has remained in the shadows. Leon lists two key catalysts for a potential price increase of ETH to $8,000 or even $10,000 this year. The first catalyst he mentions is the planned Dencun update this month, which aims to make transactions on Layer 2 networks cheaper. The update is expected to increase network efficiency and attract mainstream consumer demand for Ethereum.

As a second catalyst, Leon points to the excitement surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a final decision on spot Ethereum ETFs in May. Although Leon admits that the likelihood of approval is less clear compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs, he still gives it a 50-60% chance and emphasizes that it’s only a matter of time.
The potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to significantly increase Ethereum’s appeal among conservative, institutional investors and draw a strong demand similar to that seen with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted about $9 billion in net inflows earlier this year.
Bernstein Also Expects a Rise in ETH
Furthermore, a recent report from leading brokerage firm Bernstein points to various factors supporting a bullish outlook for ETH, including deflationary supply, a staking boom led by EigenLayer, and increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.
Although Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin in reaching all-time highs, historical models show that BTC typically leads the market’s recovery, with ETH and other altcoins following suit. As Bitcoin approaches and surpasses its all-time high (ATH), ETH could start a rally lasting several months to reach new peaks.
Current data shows ETH has risen 3.41% in the last 24 hours to trade at $3,900. In the same period, Bitcoin has seen a smaller increase of 1.72%, showing a lower performance compared to the altcoin king.

Ethereum’s Base Team Backs Dencun Upgrade to Slash Layer-2 Fees,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Ethereum’s Base Team Backs Dencun Upgrade to Slash Layer-2 Fees
Base, a prominent Layer-2 network for Ethereum, has voiced strong backing for the Dencun upgrade slated for release. This upgrade is set to introduce the anticipated EIP-4844 protocol, with the potential of slashing transaction fees by over 90%, a move expected to notably benefit rollup solutions. The Dencun upgrade stands out as a pivotal enhancement for Ethereum, promising to make Layer-2 solutions significantly more affordable for users.
Imminent Dencun Upgrade Enhances Data Availability
On the horizon for March 13, the Dencun upgrade looks to bolster data availability, thereby supporting a sweeping fee reduction for rollup users. The Base team has confirmed its readiness to support the new upgrade from its inception. Additionally, the Ecotone OP Stack upgrade, coming on the heels of Dencun, promises to bring advantages to various Layer-2 ecosystems and the Optimism Superchain, where Base is a key participant.
Layer-2 to Reap Benefits from EIP-4844 Integration
With EIP-4844, Ethereum’s Layer-1 blocks will feature new data packages or ‘blobs’, offering a boost in data availability without jeopardizing existing infrastructure. This development is set to enable cheaper Layer-2 transactions and maintain cost-effectiveness even during network congestion spikes, thanks to an independent fee market for blobs.
The Base team has highlighted that the Dencun upgrade will not only reduce costs but also accelerate transaction speeds. This advancement could lead to more accessible decentralized apps, particularly in gaming and order book exchanges. Other Layer-2 projects like Polygon, zkSync, and Arbitrum are aligning with Base in predicting fee reductions ensuing the upgrade.
The anticipated Dencun upgrade is poised to bring substantial benefits for Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem users. Industry analysts and experts predict that the decreased transaction fees could bolster interest in Layer-2 project tokens, potentially driving significant momentum for networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism in the near future.

"Pullix (PLX) Shows The Dog Tokens DOGE, SHIB and BONK How It’s Done",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) are three meme coins that have recently been dominant on the charts and have provided traders with high ROI. Yet, despite their success, the Pullix (PLX) crypto has shown a massive upwards momentum, and can become a major competitor in the industry, especially as it spiked significantly following the completion of its blockchain ICO. Today, we will go over the on-chart performance for each one to see how far they can rise.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 103% – Is the Future Bullish?
Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a notable price upswing during the past trading sessions which could result in far more significant gains in the upcoming rally. During the previous month, the Dogecoin price USD increased by 103%. 
Moreover, the weekly price performance has also been bullish, where the Dogecoin chart indicates how the crypto moved up by 61% from a low point of $0.09987 to a maximum value point of $0.1984.
With this in mind, according to the Dogecoin price prediction, it can end 2024 at $0.2367, making it a solid meme coin to diversify with. 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast – Grows 286%
Shiba Inu (SHIB) also showcased a massive upwards momentum and could soon breach new records. Specifically, the Shiba Inu price has seen a massive climb of 286% during the past month.
Just in the previous seven days, the  Shiba Inu crypto moved up from a low point of value of $0.00001113 to a maximum value at $0.000044. At this rate of growth, its primed to reach new heights, and according to the Shiba Inu price prediction it can end 2024 at $0.000042.
Bonk (BONK) Grows 5,466% – Can It Climb Further Upwards?
Bonk (BONK) is moving upwards at a rapid basis as well, as just during the past year, it climbed by 5,466% In addition, the Bonk price also showcased dominant performance on the monthly chart with a 209% upswing.
Moreover, the Bonk crypto is up by 101% on a weekly level, where its price climbed from a low point of $0.00001491 to a maximum value at $0.00004302. According to the  Bonk price prediction, the meme coin can end 2024 at $0.000038.
Pullix (PLX) DeFi Token Surges 320% and Can See a Potential 100x Increase at Launch
Pullix (PLX) is making waves within the Web3 space, and is a DeFi token that will lock the liquidity on Uniswap for two years, which has increased confidence in its long-term outlook. Moreover, it’s been listed on XT.com and will soon get listed on BitMart, scheduled to occur on March 7, which has resulted in far more interest.
This upcoming hybrid exchange stands out as it will combine elements of CEXs and DEXs to create a hybrid approach, and will even integrate a Trade-to-Earn model, where anyone can get a portion of the daily revenue by staking their PLX balance. Value and scarcity can also increase as there’s a token-burn feature implemented as-well. 
The earliest investors got 320% in ROI as its price moved from $0.04 to $0.168. However, since then, the PLX price has reached a new high of $0.73, and experts are bullish on the future of the DeFi token and project that it can spike 100x, especially as it enters the $40 trillion OTC derivatives market.
During its presale, Pullix sold over 130 million tokens and raised $9.5 million, indicating a massive level of interest, and making it one of the hottest projects to jump into during 2024, and with this bullish momentum, can show DOGE, SHIB and BONK how its done.

Massive Fetch.ai Whale Goes on FET Buying Spree Amid AI Crypto Hype,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"A crypto whale just caught our attention with an accumulation of Fetch.ai’s FET token, fueling speculation that the whale is positioning for major upside potential driven by AI narrative gaining traction.
On-chain data from SpotOnChain reveals that a single Ethereum whale address (0xa7b…) has scooped up a staggering 13.92 million FET tokens over the past 6 days at an average price of $1.885. With FET currently trading around $2.56, this positions the whale with over $34.5 million worth of FET and an unrealized profit of $8.84 million (33.7% gains).
The whale’s accumulation frenzy saw two particularly large transactions this week:

Transaction 1: Withdrawal of 507,585 FET ($1.33M) from Binance and Gate.io at $2.623 average (0x0651f57461d32e93aabc59fe5b32631ea3c396feda307064082961f71476b7ba)
Transaction 2: Withdrawal of 507,585 FET ($1.33M) from Binance and Gate.io at $2.623 average (0xca24b78c1179a0a29a12d6c43aea6675c0c5e606642ffd3b1b27de214cc5d696)




This epic FET buying spree from the whale comes amid the backdrop of surging prices for AI and machine learning-focused crypto projects like Fetch.ai. FET itself has pumped over 60% this week, riding on the coattails of the red-hot AI narrative sweeping the crypto markets.
While the motivations of the whale cannot be confirmed, the substantial bets placed on FET suggest the whale is extremely bullish on the project’s potential within the AI crypto arena. Some analysts speculate the whale may be an institutional player preparing for Fetch.ai protocol upgrades or major partnership announcements that could catalyze FET’s price higher.

Interestingly, SpotOnChain notes that this whale had previously incurred estimated losses of around $957,000 from trading Basic Attention Token (BAT) between late 2021 and early 2023. It seems the whale is looking to recoup those losses and more with the aggressive FET accumulation.
In the high-stakes game of whales, the Fetch.ai marine giant is clearly betting big that the AI crypto wave will lift all boats.

Polygon (MATIC) & Bitcoin (BTC) Investors Show Kelexo (KLXO) Presale Love: 30X Potential Unveiled,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"With the end of Q1 2024 drawing to a close, investors are aggressively pouring capital into tokens and hoping to ride the current rise in market value. Polygon (MATIC) and Bitcoin (BTC) investors are actively looking for a token to invest in. An expert trader has said this is because token value will be lost when the market balances itself out.
The presale token of the yet-to-launch crypto lending platform, Kelexo (KLXO), is the chosen protocol. With its token presale stage, two, and selling for just $0.028, Kelexo (KLXO) is now looking at a 30x potential unveiled with Polygon (MATIC) and Bitcoin (BTC) holders buying in.
Polygon (MATIC) upgrade to POL close to finishing
The Polygon (MATIC) protocol has begun its upgrade from Polygon (MATIC) to Polygon (POL). This will be the second upgrade of Polygon (MATIC), formerly the Matic Network. The Polygon (MATIC) is a well-structured Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development platform.
As of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is ranked #15 by market capitalization and has a total market worth of $9.9B. Amidst its market loss, Polygon (MATIC) has gained an impressive 32.93% market activity, raising its average daily trading value to $1.4B. Rumor has it that Polygon (MATIC) holders actively buy into the Kelexo (KLXO) presale to shock their current portfolio loss.
Bitcoin (BTC) hits $1.2T in total market capitalization.
A business firm has asked the US SEC to recognize the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF as a security of its firm, but the SEC has once again postponed its decision. While this could be seen as negative news, it doesn’t seem to affect the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Now selling at $63K, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the crypto market’s top currency. With a total gain of 11.12%, Bitcoin (BTC) now has a total market value of $1.2T. Crypto analysts have suggested the market could see a buy-in as US stocks have dropped, but Bitcoin (BTC) has gained impressively.
Kelexo (KLXO) boycotts scalability issues in crypto lending
As a Web3 platform, Kelexo (KLXO) is the first of its kind. Kelexo (KLXO) is a decentralized platform that differs from liquidity pool protocols. With the old token lending platform, users donate their tokens into a pool, and then members can request loans. These loans are processed in 3 working days, creating delays that do not suit emergency purposes. The Kelexo (KLXO) protocol has found a way to avoid these scalability issues.
On Kelexo (KLXO), users will get an instant deposit of their tokens with no issues. Kelexo (KLXO) will have no scalability issues as a first-time mover. At the forefront of decentralization, Kelexo (KLXO) has made its crypto lending transactions fully peer-to-peer with no third-party influence in the mix.

As the market awaits employment data from the United States later today, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto asset, suggests further growth in the near term. Up more than 65 percent in the past four weeks to trade slightly above $3,900 on Friday during the early London session, Ethereum price aims to retest its all-time high (ATH) similar to Bitcoin in the coming weeks.
Ethereum’s Fundamental Positions and Market Check
Ethereum network remains the undisputed benchmark for decentralized smart contracts for mainstream web3 projects despite the notable competition from other layer one (L1) projects like Solana (SOL), and BSC. As of this writing, the Ethereum network had the largest stablecoins supply and a total value locked (TVL) of about $55 billion. 
The Ethereum network is preparing to activate the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet on March 13, 2024. The Dencun upgrade will entail several changes, but the most notable one will lower the transaction fees for Layer Two (L2).
Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has enjoyed a bullish outlook due to the heightened speculation on the possible approval of several spot Ether ETFs in the United States in the coming months.

"What Will Be The Price Of Top Altcoins Solana (SOL) and Retik Finance (RETIK) When Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $100,000, $200,000?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to capture the attention of investors and traders alike, many are eager to predict the potential price movements of other leading cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, such as Solana (SOL) and Retik Finance (RETIK). With Bitcoin’s price projected to reach significant milestones like $100,000 and $200,000, it’s natural to wonder how these altcoins will fare in such scenarios. In this article, we’ll explore the potential price trajectories of Solana and Retik Finance as Bitcoin reaches these landmark price levels.
Click Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale
Bitcoin’s Influence on Altcoins
Before delving into specific price predictions for Solana (SOL) and Retik Finance (RETIK), it’s essential to understand the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. Historically, Bitcoin has served as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin experiences significant price movements, it often sets the tone for altcoins, which tend to follow suit, albeit with varying degrees of correlation.
Solana (SOL) Price Predictions
Solana has emerged as one of the most promising altcoins, known for its high throughput, low fees, and rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). As of the time of writing, Solana’s price hovers around $130, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
When Bitcoin Hits $100,000
If Bitcoin reaches $100,000, it’s likely that Solana will experience a significant price surge as well. Given Solana’s historical correlation with Bitcoin and its strong fundamentals, analysts predict that SOL could surpass $500 in such a scenario. Factors such as increased institutional adoption, ecosystem growth, and market sentiment could further fuel SOL’s rally.
When Bitcoin Hits $200,000
Should Bitcoin’s price climb to $200,000, Solana’s price trajectory could be even more bullish. With growing recognition of Solana’s technological capabilities and utility, some analysts speculate that SOL could exceed $1,000 in this scenario. Continued development, partnerships, and adoption would contribute to SOL’s upward momentum.

Retik Finance (RETIK) Price Predictions
Retik Finance (RETIK), often touted as a potential disruptor in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has garnered attention for its innovative features and strong community support. While relatively newer compared to Solana, Retik Finance has shown promise with its presale success and growing ecosystem. Retik Finance (RETIK) represents a pioneering force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, offering a comprehensive ecosystem of innovative financial solutions designed to revolutionize global transactions. At its core, Retik Finance aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto realm by providing users with access to cutting-edge DeFi services. The ecosystem encompasses a range of groundbreaking features, including futuristic DeFi debit cards, smart crypto payment gateways, AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, and multi-chain non-custodial highly secured DeFi wallets. These offerings cater to different aspects of financial management, providing users with enhanced flexibility, security, and accessibility when managing their assets in the crypto space. By combining advanced technology with user-centric design, Retik Finance empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance with ease, driving mainstream adoption and reshaping the future of global finance.
When Bitcoin Hits $100,000
For Retik Finance (RETIK), reaching a $100,000 Bitcoin milestone would likely coincide with significant bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Given Retik Finance’s potential for growth and its early-stage development, some analysts project that RETIK could achieve a price range of $50 to $100. Factors such as project milestones, adoption, and market dynamics would influence RETIK’s price movement.
When Bitcoin Hits $200,000
In a scenario where Bitcoin surpasses $200,000, Retik Finance’s price trajectory could be even more pronounced. With continued development, adoption, and community engagement, RETIK could potentially reach double-digit price levels, ranging from $200 to $500. However, it’s essential to consider market volatility and external factors that may impact RETIK’s performance.
Conclusion
While predicting the exact price movements of altcoins like Solana and Retik Finance in response to Bitcoin’s price milestones is inherently speculative, it’s evident that both projects have significant potential for growth. As Bitcoin continues to set new records, altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Retik Finance (RETIK) stand to benefit from increased investor interest, adoption, and market sentiment. Ultimately, investors should conduct thorough research, assess risk factors, and consider their investment objectives before making decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

Do Kwon’s Fate Uncertain Amid Appeals and US Prosecutors’ Challenge,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"The High Court in Podgorica, Montenegro, has determined that Do Kwon, co-founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, should be extradited to South Korea rather than the United States. However, according to various media outlets, this decision is currently open to appeal.
An appeals court overturned the initial ruling to extradite Kwon to the United States on March 5, citing “significant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure.” 
Dramatic Arrest of Do Kwon
Do Kwon has been in Montenegrin prison since his arrest at the Podgorica airport, where he was attempting to travel to Dubai using an allegedly fake Costa Rican passport.
Montenegrin authorities were tipped off about Kwon’s presence by a source the day before his planned flight, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Notably, Kwon is reportedly set to face a 40-year prison term in South Korea. He had expressed a preference for extradition to South Korea, stating that he’ll be closer to his family. His legal team questioned the validity of the extradition treaty with the United States. 
US Prosecutors Contest the Decision
In response to the latest Montenegrin high court ruling favoring extradition to South Korea, U.S. prosecutors have contested the decision. The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) expressed its intention to continue seeking Do Kwon’s extradition in accordance with international and bilateral agreements, as well as Montenegrin law. According to a March 7 report by Bloomberg, DoJ states:
“The United States appreciates the cooperation of the Montenegrin authorities in ensuring that all individuals are subject to the rule of law.”
More on Extradition Request
South Korea and the United States filed extradition requests for Kwon in March 2023, leading to an ongoing dispute over jurisdiction. Do Kwon was initially set to be extradited to the United States following a ruling by the High Court in Podgorica.
Interestingly, Terraform Labs’ chief financial officer, Han Chang-joon, who was arrested alongside Kwon at the airport, was already extradited to South Korea in February.
Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States on January 21, following the collapse of the Terra stablecoin and LUNA governance token in May 2022. Do Kwon, who had maintained a social media presence with over a million followers on X, was not seen after the collapse until his arrest in Montenegro.
Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon reportedly resided in Serbia after leaving South Korea, where they had started a consulting business, despite an Interpol “red notice” issued for Kwon.

Ethereum’s Base Team Announces Support for Upcoming Dencun Upgrade,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 03:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Ethereum’s Base Team Announces Support for Upcoming Dencun Upgrade
The popular Ethereum Layer-2 network Base team has announced it will provide support from day one for the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to reduce transaction fees within the ecosystem and includes the much-anticipated EIP-4844. The Dencun upgrade on Ethereum is expected to significantly lower fees for Layer-2 users. Predictions from Base indicate a reduction of over 90%, especially benefiting rollups.
Base Team’s Announcement on Dencun Upgrade
The Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, will bring changes that increase data availability. This upgrade on the mainnet will be closely followed by the Ecotone OP Stack upgrade, which will benefit other Layer-2 ecosystems such as Mode, Zora, Aevo, and Fraxtal, as well as the Optimism Superchain ecosystem, of which Base is a part. The team made the following statement regarding the matter:

“Base will provide support for the Dencun upgrade from the first day, and this upgrade is expected to reduce fees for users by 10 to 100 times through increased data availability for rollups.”

EIP-4844 introduces a new concept of blobs within Layer-1 blocks. These blobs are designed as an additional feature that increases Ethereum’s data availability without affecting the existing infrastructure, resulting in cheaper transactions in Layer-2 ecosystems. An independent fee market for blobs ensures costs remain low even during periods of high network congestion.

Dencun Upgrade and the Layer-2 Ecosystem
The team also noted that the upgrade will help make transactions faster and cheaper, thus making decentralized applications in areas such as gaming and order book exchanges more accessible on the chain. Meanwhile, other Layer-2 projects like Polygon, zkSync, and Arbitrum have also made similar predictions about fee reductions following the Dencun upgrade.
The Dencun upgrade is expected to bring significant benefits for users in Ethereum-based Layer-2 ecosystems. According to many analysts and experts, this reduction in transaction fees could increase interest in the native tokens of Layer-2 projects. In particular, popular network tokens like Arbitrum and Optimism are expected to gain serious momentum in the coming days.

Surge in Fantom’s Trading Volume and Price Dynamics Spurs Investor Scrutiny,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Surge in Fantom’s Trading Volume and Price Dynamics Spurs Investor Scrutiny
Recent developments in the Fantom (FTM) cryptocurrency market have captured the attention of investors as a noteworthy surge in trading volume and price is observed. On March 3, 2024, a record trading volume was posted, showcasing the heightened market activity surrounding FTM. The increased interest has led to a dramatic rise in value, with the token’s price escalating sharply within a short timeframe. Despite this, a subsequent decline in volume could signal a shift in the market’s dynamics, potentially affecting future price actions.
Record-Breaking Trading Volumes
Trading volumes for Fantom experienced an exponential jump from early February to March, bringing to light a heightened investor engagement. The value of FTM rose in tandem with the trading activity, accentuating the positive correlation between volume and price. Nevertheless, a sudden drop in volume following the peak suggests a cooling off that investors are carefully monitoring for its possible implications on the token’s valuation.
Investor Sentiment and Price Implications
Currently, a majority of FTM holders are profiting, which may induce a selling trend to secure gains. On the flip side, a significant cohort of holders incurring losses might look to offload their holdings as prices reach their break-even points, injecting additional selling pressure into the market. This could serve as a barrier to upward price movements and potentially lead to a price stabilization or correction phase.
The market’s response to those holders who are neither gaining nor losing is yet to unfold, but their influence cannot be discounted, especially if the price sees high volatility. Lastly, despite a substantial appreciation in FTM’s value recently, nearly half of its holders have not reached profitability, hinting at further growth potential and a potentially bright future for the token’s valuation.

Analyst Forecasts Major Surge for Solana-Based Meme Token,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Analyst Forecasts Major Surge for Solana-Based Meme Token
Bluntz, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency analysis sphere, has recently projected a significant spike in value for the meme token dogwifhat (WIF), associated with the Solana (SOL) platform. Bluntz’s prediction is based on the token’s recent V-shaped recovery, an indication of a potential bullish trend. With a staggering 994% increase in just four weeks, WIF’s price surge from $0.190 to $2.08 as of the latest reports has sparked considerable investor interest. Bluntz anticipates that WIF could see an additional 44% increase, reaching new heights of $3 in the near future.
Technical Analysis Backing WIF’s Growth
Analysts have noted that WIF has exhibited a corrective three-wave pattern as per Elliott Wave theory, a model that suggests asset prices move in predictable patterns. This observation lends credence to the possibility of WIF’s continued upward trajectory.
Pepe Token Garners Optimistic Outlook
In addition to WIF, Bluntz has also shed light on the prospects of another meme token, Pepe (PEPE), which has similarly seen substantial gains over the past month. Despite its rapid ascent, PEPE has not undergone any major declines, leading to expectations of forthcoming price increases. The price movement of PEPE is tracked by the 1000PEPE perpetual contract, which denotes 1000 units of the token.
The momentum behind these meme tokens, particularly within the Solana ecosystem, underscores a growing enthusiasm for altcoins and their potential for profitability. Bluntz’s forecasts are fueling discussions among investors and market watchers as they monitor these digital assets for signs of continued growth.
As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the focus on meme tokens like WIF and PEPE and their performance could signal new opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on these niche markets. The attention given to these tokens highlights their importance in the broader context of the crypto economy.

Binance recently shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) trading services on its platform.
The exchange also withdrew its application for an Abu Dhabi license. 
German regulator BaFin rejected Binance’s application for a license.

Binance, the world’s largest digital currency trading platform by trading volume, has restricted its services in multiple countries around the world while completely ending operations in some, due to the regulatory pressure in these nations. 
As per the exchange’s list of ‘prohibited countries,’ Binance is not operable in Canada, the Netherlands, the United States, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (“DPRK”), Iran, Syria, the Crimea region, or any non-government controlled areas of Ukraine.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Never Drop To This Level: Predicts Cryptoquant Founder,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Never Drop To This Level: Predicts Cryptoquant Founder appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Ki Young Ju’s analysis draws a fascinating comparison between Bitcoin’s current trajectory and gold’s historical behavior following the ETFs’ introduction. When the Gold ETF (GLD) debuted on the NYSE in 2004 at around $444, it marked a significant milestone in the accessibility of gold investments for institutional and retail investors.
As gold became more accessible, more institutional investors poured money into the market through the ETF to get into the precious metal.



#Bitcoin's first spot ETF was approved in January 2024 when its price was $46,376.NYSE listed the first gold ETF in Nov 2004, and the price never came back. https://t.co/aiDB3ie4Um pic.twitter.com/y5YG4LGj07— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 7, 2024




Gold ETF Impact: Historical Comparison
Ju uses historical gold market trends to support this claim. In 2004, the NYSE introduced the Gold ETF (GLD), which affected gold prices. Since the ETF listing, gold has never returned to $444. Ju credits increasing accessibility and ETF-facilitated institutional inflows for this phenomenon.
Similarly, Ju also argues that introducing spot Bitcoin ETFs could have a comparable effect on Bitcoin’s price dynamics. Despite initial skepticism, the accessibility provided by ETFs could lead to sustained institutional interest and investment inflows, thereby establishing a price floor for Bitcoin.
Future Outlook: Potential for New Highs
Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $66,964, marking a notable increase since the approval of 11 spot BTC ETFs by the SEC in January. This surge in price, coupled with the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by ETF issuers, has created a supply crunch in the market. On average, ETF issuers are accumulating around 10,000 BTC, significantly higher than the daily mining output of approximately 900 BTC. This imbalance between supply and demand, along with the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, could potentially drive Bitcoin’s price to new highs in the future.
In short, Ju’s perspective on Bitcoin’s price floor and the impact of ETF listings highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the various factors that influence price movements. While Bitcoin’s price trajectory remains uncertain, insights from experts like Ki Young Ju provide valuable perspectives for investors and enthusiasts alike.","['XKI', 'BTC', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'GOLD']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eabaeae9c9d311fbae63a2/
"Rising Crypto Stars: Fet, Render, Akt, Rune, and Flow",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"The crypto industry has undergone a meteoric evolution in recent years, reaching unprecedented heights.

Fantom’s Price Trends and Ecosystem Impact Attract Investor Attention,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Fantom’s Price Trends and Ecosystem Impact Attract Investor Attention
Fantom’s latest price trends and ecosystem data indicate that many FTM holders are profiting. Current chart patterns suggest that the $0.76 support levels might be tested, while investors critically analyze FTM charts for the next decisive move. Will Fantom’s technological capabilities continue to overcome resistance levels, or will it succumb to downward pressure? We are examining this together.
Continued Intense Interest in Fantom
On March 3, 2024, Fantom’s daily trading volume reached $235 million, achieving a significant milestone. This was the largest daily volume recorded since February 11, 2023, highlighting a peak in trading activity. When we examine the growth in trading volume over the month, we see that the volume increased from $8.3 million on February 6, 2024, to $73 million on March 3, 2024. This represents an astonishing increase of approximately 780%. The strong positive correlation with Fantom’s price rising from $0.36 to $0.64 during the same period is noteworthy.

However, the trading volume declined from the peak of $73 million on March 3 to $35 million on March 6. Such a sharp decrease in trading volume in a short period could indicate a slowdown in activities.
This drop in volume could potentially have a negative impact on the price. The reason is that a decrease in volume could mean a reduction in trading interest or network usage. However, even though the trading volume has decreased in the last few days, it is still well above the data from the beginning of the previous month, which could be considered a bullish signal.
FTM Investors and Price Factors
This week, 52.25% of FTM token holders are profiting from their investments, which could potentially lead to an increase in the tendency to sell to secure these gains. In contrast, a significant portion consisting of 48,800 addresses, which make up 46.12%, are currently facing losses. It could be speculated that these holders might be encouraged to sell their assets to recover their initial investments if the FTM price approaches the break-even point.
Such actions could act as a challenging barrier against potential upward price trends, leading to increased selling pressure. As a result, this scenario could initiate a phase of price stabilization or potentially trigger a market correction, reducing upward momentum.

Additionally, about 1,730 addresses, representing 1.63%, are neither making a profit nor a loss from their investments. Although seemingly insignificant, this group can still have a noticeable impact on market dynamics, especially if significant volatility occurs in the price.
FTM’s impressive 70% increase within a week, yet nearly half of the token holders are still incurring losses, underscores a convincing factor that there is significant potential for the price to gain further value. This situation reflects the underlying sentiment that Fantom’s valuation has not fully realized its growth trajectory and presents a promising outlook for future price developments.

Cardano Price Forecast: When ADA $5? Polygon (MATIC) And Retik Finance (RETIK) Could Get There Quicker,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"Rapid price swings and volatility are commonplace in the  cryptocurrency market, where investors are always looking for the next great thing. With its emphasis on scalability, seamless integration, and  sustainability, Cardano (ADA), a digital currency and blockchain  platform, is one of the leading candidates for a large price increase.  Many investors are curious as to when ADA, the company’s native token,  would hit the coveted $5 milestone, given that it is presently trading  at $0.7. But while everyone is speculating on Cardano’s price  prediction, rival up-and-coming projects like Polygon and Retik Finance  are also gathering momentum, creating a race to $5. With all indications  pointing to the fact that the latest DeFi sensation, Retik Finance will  take the lead in the race to the $5 mark, while Polygon will be closely  following. This leaves a dark cloud on the prospects of Cardano. We’ll  look at what influences Cardano’s price prediction, consider whether  MATIC and RETIK can hit $5, and evaluate the competitive environment in  the cryptocurrency space in this in-depth examination.Cardano Price PredictionOne of the most exciting blockchain initiatives, Cardano has long  been praised for its emphasis on scholarly research, subject to peer  review development, and continuous scalability. Because of this, ADA has  attracted a lot of interest from investors and fans alike, however many  believe it will not likely hit $5 in the foreseeable future. This  pessimistic outlook is influenced by a number of things, notably the  slow progress of the Cardano ecosystem. Although precise timeframes are  hard to forecast in the erratic cryptocurrency industry, a lot of  observers think it will take a while before Cardano’s price appreciates  noticeably as more investors find comfort in the more popular newer  options. While the prospects of ADA keep fading, the lights of Newer  Projects like Retik Finance shines bright and it is widely believed that  it would hit the $5 mark before Cardano does, the same sentiment also  applies with Polygon.The Prospects of Retik Finance (RETIK)Retik Finance (RETIK) has become a prominent DeFi initiative, drawing  interest from investors looking for high-growth prospects and providing  creative solutions for decentralized financing. The possibility for  RETIK to reach $5 is very significant, considering its low pricing and  burgeoning community support, especially with its solid foundations.  Experts also believe that the imminent listing of RETIK on Crypto  Exchanges would propel the price of the coin to hit $5 in three months.  The impending rally will inturn create new millionaires – those who take  the chance to purchase RETIK earlier on.The Ascent of Polygon (MATIC)While Cardano’s ambitious plan and development potential have  garnered attention, there are other initiatives in the cryptocurrency  industry that are gaining traction. Because Polygon (MATIC), a layer 2  scaling alternative for Ethereum, can speed up transactions and lower  network costs, its popularity has increased dramatically in recent  months. Many investors believe that there is a large upside possibility  for MATIC to reach $5 or more, given that its native coin, MATIC, is  gaining speed. This is especially true given that Ethereum is still  having issues with scalability. Experts give a 15 month timeline for  MATIC to reach $5, it remains to be seen how the forecast goes.The Road to $5: Market Dynamics and Competitive EnvironmentRetik Finance, Cardano, and Polygon are vying for market supremacy in  the cryptocurrency space, and the race to $5 sheds light on the  competitive environment and prevailing market dynamics. Although Cardano  has a solid track record and is widely used, Polygon and Retik Finance  provide distinctive value propositions and cutting-edge solutions that  have the potential to upend the current quo. Investors are offered a  wide array of options to profit from the cryptocurrency market’s growth  potential, with each project aiming to raise $5. However, before making  any financial selections, careful study must be done. Profit is assured  with these coins, no doubt about it. RETIK will lead the way, closely  followed by Polygon, with Cardano further behind.ConclusionFor investors, the race to $5 for Polygon, Cardano, and Retik Finance  is a thrilling chance to profit from the market’s potential for growth.  Cardano’s price prediction remains undecided, while Retik Finance and  Polygon are emerging as more credible competitors in the race to a price  of $5.Investors should be aware and alert as these ventures progress  further, closely monitoring market trends and new developments.

Digital Currency Group’s Merger Proposal for Genesis and Gemini Revealed in Court Documents,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"The post Digital Currency Group’s Merger Proposal for Genesis and Gemini Revealed in Court Documents appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent court documents, an email exchange from 2022 brought an interesting proposal from Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), suggesting a potential merger between Genesis and Gemini.
Exploring Merger Aspirations
DCG, the owner of the bankrupt Genesis, considered a “commercial partnership” aimed at competing with major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and FTX. The ambitious plan included taking the merged entity public within 24 months, with the possibility of raising $500-1 billion.
In the email exchange, Silbert suggested combining Genesis and Gemini could make a powerful team. Silbert shared this proposal with Cameron Winklevoss in 2022, who planned to discuss it with his twin brother, Tyler Winklevoss, to figure out the next steps.
Joint “Earn” Program Challenges
Genesis and Gemini had jointly introduced an “Earn” program, enabling customers to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings. However, the program faced setbacks, leading Genesis to freeze customer withdrawals in November 2022.
In January 2023, Genesis Global took a significant step by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, seeking $1.1 billion for its Earn program users. Notably, Gemini reportedly withdrew approximately $280 million from Genesis shortly before the freeze and bankruptcy filing.
Adding to the complexity, Genesis and Gemini faced allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2023. The regulatory body claimed that the Earn program constituted an unregistered sale of securities.
DCG’s $1 Billion Debt Settlement
In a separate finding, DCG announced in January that it successfully settled over $1 billion in debt, including a substantial amount owed to its bankrupt subsidiary, Genesis.However, Barry Silbert shared this milestone on the Xplatform, marking a significant achievement for DCG. The debt settlement process began after Genesis filed a lawsuit against DCG and its affiliate, DCG International Investments (DCIG), in September. These revelations shed light on the complex dynamics within the crypto industry.","['LGC', 'GEMINI', 'BILL', 'CEO']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab898e9c9d311fbae639a/
Appellate Court Rules Residents Can Fight Crypto Mine Over Climate Concerns,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Ultramining_Eng,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"A New York appellate court has granted environmental groups the green light to challenge the state-approved transformation of an upstate gas-fired power plant into a cryptocurrency mining operation. This decision comes after the Sierra Club and the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York filed a lawsuit against the New York Public Service Commission's approval of the project, arguing it would significantly increase pollution in nearby neighborhoods and contravene New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) of 2019. The act aims for zero-emissions electricity by 2040, among other environmental goals, according to Courthousenews.
The initial ruling by a state judge dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds of lack of standing, but the appellate court's reversal is based on the proximity of the plaintiffs to the proposed crypto mining site. This proximity, the court ruled, gives them the right to challenge the project under the CLCPA due to the direct impact it could have on them, differentiating their concerns from more generalized environmental worries.
The power plant, located in North Tonawanda between Buffalo and Niagara Falls, typically operates only during high-demand periods each year but could run continuously as a crypto mine, potentially increasing its greenhouse gas emissions by up to 3,500%. The New York Public Service Commission had previously allowed Digihost, a Canadian crypto company, to take over the plant despite these environmental concerns, stating that these issues were beyond the scope of their review process.
This appellate decision does not halt the project but allows the plaintiffs to argue their case in court regarding potential violations of the climate act. Earthjustice, representing the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as a victory for local communities' rights to challenge decisions affecting their health, safety, and quality of life. The case now moves forward, potentially setting a precedent for how environmental laws are applied to the burgeoning cryptocurrency mining industry.","['SRA', 'SRA']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab896e9c9d311fbae6398/

Basic Principles
In traditional financial markets, market making relies on established principles such as inventory management, order flow analysis, and risk management. However, the cryptocurrency market presents unique challenges due to its decentralized nature, 24/7 trading, and lack of regulation. Market makers in the crypto space must adapt their strategies to account for these factors, often relying on advanced algorithms to stay competitive.
Market Making in Crypto vs. Traditional Markets
While the fundamentals of market making remain similar across different asset classes, there are notable differences between crypto and traditional markets. Cryptocurrency exchanges operate differently from traditional stock exchanges, with varying fee structures, order types, and trading mechanisms. Additionally, the need for more regulation and oversight in the crypto space introduces additional risks and uncertainties for market makers.
Importance of Advanced Algorithms
The advent of advanced algorithms has revolutionized market making in the cryptocurrency realm. These algorithms utilize sophisticated strategies and real-time data analysis to optimize trading decisions and adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. 
Fundamentals of Market Making Algorithms
Market making algorithms serve as the backbone of efficient trading strategies in the cryptocurrency market. These algorithms employ sophisticated techniques and real-time data analysis to optimize pricing, manage risk, and enhance liquidity provision. Understanding the fundamentals of market making algorithms is essential for traders and investors looking to capitalize on opportunities in crypto trading.
Types of Market Making Algorithms
Several types of market making algorithms exist, each designed to address specific trading objectives and market conditions. Common types include:

Fixed Spread: These algorithms maintain a constant spread between buy and sell prices, providing liquidity at predefined levels.
Dynamic Spread: Dynamic spread algorithms adjust pricing dynamically based on market conditions, such as order book depth, volatility, and liquidity.
Statistical Arbitrage: Statistical arbitrage algorithms identify mispricings or inefficiencies in the market and capitalize on them by simultaneously trading correlated assets.
Order Book Analysis: These algorithms analyze order book dynamics and liquidity profiles to optimize pricing and execution strategies.

Parameters and Variables
Market making algorithms rely on various parameters and variables to make informed trading decisions and adjust pricing dynamically. Key parameters include:

Order Book Dynamics: Analysis of order book depth, spread, and liquidity levels to determine optimal pricing levels and placement of orders.
Price Movements: Monitoring price movements and trends to anticipate market direction and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
Risk Management: Implementing risk management techniques to mitigate exposure to market volatility and adverse price movements.

Execution Strategies
Effective execution strategies are essential for successful crypto market making. Market making algorithms employ various execution tactics, including:

Continuous Quoting: Continuously quoting buy and sell prices to provide liquidity and facilitate trade execution for market participants.
Smart Order Routing: Routing orders to multiple trading venues and liquidity pools to optimize execution quality and minimize trading costs.
Time-Based Execution: Timing trades based on market conditions, trading volume, and volatility to maximize profitability and minimize risk exposure.

Advanced Market Making Strategies
In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency trading, advanced market making strategies are essential for staying competitive and maximizing profitability. These strategies leverage sophisticated techniques and data-driven approaches to optimize pricing, manage risk, and enhance liquidity provision in crypto markets.
Arbitrage Opportunities
One of the primary strategies advanced crypto market makers, like Yellow Capital, Wintermute, or Gotbit, employ is arbitrage, which involves exploiting price discrepancies between different trading venues or various cryptocurrency pairs. Arbitrage opportunities can arise due to inefficiencies in market pricing, latency differences between exchanges, or regulatory arbitrage stemming from differing regulatory regimes across jurisdictions.

Triangular Arbitrage: Triangular arbitrage involves exploiting price differentials between three cryptocurrencies to profit from market inefficiencies. Market makers identify triangular arbitrage opportunities by analyzing exchange rates and order book dynamics across multiple trading pairs simultaneously.

Statistical Arbitrage Techniques
Advanced market makers widely use statistical arbitrage techniques to identify and capitalize on mispricings or deviations from market equilibrium. These techniques leverage statistical models and historical data analysis to detect patterns and correlations in asset prices, enabling market makers to execute profitable trading strategies.

Pairs Trading: Pairs trading involves simultaneously buying and selling two correlated assets to profit from temporary deviations from their historical relationship. Market makers identify pairs trading opportunities by analyzing the correlation coefficient between asset prices and executing trades when the relationship diverges from its historical average.
Mean Reversion Strategies: Mean reversion strategies capitalize on the tendency of asset prices to revert to their long-term mean or equilibrium level after experiencing temporary deviations. Market makers identify mean reversion opportunities by monitoring price movements and executing trades when prices deviate significantly from their historical average.

Liquidity Provision Strategies
Effective liquidity provision is essential for market makers to attract trading volume and maintain competitive pricing in crypto markets. Advanced market makers employ sophisticated liquidity provision strategies to optimize order placement, minimize slippage, and enhance execution quality for market participants.

Dark Pool Trading: These platforms allow market makers to execute large block trades off-exchange, minimizing market impact and reducing information leakage. Market makers leverage dark pools to provide liquidity for institutional clients and execute trades with minimal price impact.
Market-Making Bots: Market-making bots are automated trading algorithms that continuously monitor order book dynamics and execute trades based on predefined parameters. These bots provide liquidity by quoting buy and sell prices, facilitating trade execution, and reducing bid-ask spread in crypto markets.

Applications of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence technologies, such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms, enable market makers to develop more sophisticated trading strategies and adapt to dynamic market conditions. AI-powered market making algorithms can:

Adapt to Market Conditions: AI algorithms analyze real-time market data and adjust trading strategies dynamically to capitalize on emerging market trends and mitigate risks.
Identify Trading Signals: AI models identify trading signals and patterns in market data, such as price movements, volume fluctuations, and order book dynamics, to generate actionable trading insights.
Optimize Execution Quality: AI algorithms optimize trade execution by analyzing order flow, market liquidity, and transaction costs to minimize slippage and maximize execution quality.

Data-Driven Approach
A data-driven approach is essential for leveraging machine learning and AI in market making. Market makers collect and analyze vast amounts of historical and real-time market data to train machine-learning models and develop predictive analytics for optimizing trading strategies.

Data Collection: Market makers collect data from various sources, including exchange APIs, market data providers, and trading platforms, to build comprehensive datasets for training machine learning models.
Data Analysis: Market makers analyze historical market data and conduct statistical analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and trends that can inform trading decisions and improve algorithm performance.
Model Training: Market makers train machine learning models using historical market data to learn patterns and relationships between market variables, such as price movements, volume fluctuations, and order book dynamics.

Importance of Risk Management
Risk management is an integral part of market making strategies, encompassing identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with trading activities. Market makers encounter various types of risks, including:

Market Risk: Exposure to fluctuations in asset prices and market volatility can lead to losses on positions.
Liquidity Risk: Risk of being unable to execute trades at desired prices due to insufficient market liquidity or large order imbalances.
Counterparty Risk: Risk of default by counterparties, such as exchanges or trading counterparties, can result in financial losses.
Operational Risk: Risk of disruptions or failures in trading systems, infrastructure, or processes, leading to trading errors or downtime.

Risk Management Techniques
Market makers employ a range of risk management techniques to mitigate these risks and protect their trading capital. Key risk management techniques include:

Position Sizing: Properly sizing trading positions based on risk tolerance, account size, and market conditions to limit potential losses and manage exposure to market volatility.
Diversification: Spreading trading activity across multiple assets, trading pairs, or exchanges to reduce concentration risk and minimize the impact of adverse price movements in any single market.
Hedging: Hedging strategies involve offsetting positions in correlated assets or derivatives to mitigate directional risk and reduce exposure to market fluctuations.
Stress Testing: Conduct stress tests and scenario analyses to assess the impact of extreme market events or adverse conditions on trading portfolios and identify vulnerabilities.

Advanced market making algorithms are essential for shaping cryptocurrency markets' liquidity, efficiency, and stability. By utilizing sophisticated strategies, leveraging data-driven insights, and adapting to changing market conditions, market makers can effectively navigate the complexities of crypto trading. This, in turn, contributes to the growth and maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. In conclusion, market makers play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency world, and their algorithms are key to ensuring successful and profitable trading.

Solana based DeFi token announced airdrop season 1,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"There’s been news that a new DeFi protocol operating on the Solana blockchain, Kamino, has recently announced the schedule for its upcoming airdrop. The first airdrop will distribute seven percent of the total supply of KMNO tokens. Scheduled for April, the airdrop will occur after a snapshot is taken of eligible users on March 31st.
In parallel news, a crypto fund Pantera Capital is reportedly looking to raise additional funds. The purpose is to acquire discounted Solana (SOL) tokens from FTX which currently is a platform facing challenges, as per a report by Bloomberg on Thursday. Kamino token airdrop 
“The amount of points you have will contribute to the amount of tokens you will get,” Kamino contributor Thomas said on a monthly Solana developer call, as per reports. In order to prevent airdrop farmers from sybil attacking the system with multiple wallets, the protocol will employ mechanisms, he explained.
Kamino lets you borrow, lend and earn yield through various trading strategies on tokens in the Solana ecosystem. As Jito and Jupiter did, it launched a points program to incentivize users and set up an airdrop.
On Thursday’s Zoom call, Thomas reportedly said the KMNO token will serve as a governance asset. In a tweet, Kamino said its holders will have influence over incentive programs, revenue disbursements, protocol operations, and risk management. Upon its April debut, 10% of the token’s total supply will be in circulation which is 10 billion tokens. And as per Kamino, another 7% of the total supply will go to the “initial community distribution.”
Airdrops will continue with subsequent “seasons” starting in April. Another airdrop is likely to happen later. “Season 2 will emphasize loyalty & sustained usage of Kamino’s products,” a tweet said. Dealing discounted Solana 
Meanwhile, on the flip side Pantera Capital is introducing the Pantera Solana Fund to potential investors. This fund aims to secure up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens at a discounted rate of 39% below the 30-day average price of $59.95. According to Bloomberg, documents sent to prospective investors last month outlined this opportunity.
Under the proposed arrangement, the acquired tokens would undergo a four-year vesting period. This initiative could enable the FTX estate to offload its SOL holdings, releasing capital for creditors. Pantera aimed to finalize the fund’s closure by the end of February and managed to raise some capital by the deadline, as reported by Bloomberg.
FTX, previously owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, a convicted fraudster and early supporter of Solana, held a substantial amount of SOL tokens. Exchanging hands at $144.35, SOL has jumped by 3.04% in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.
Despite Bankman-Fried’s controversies, SOL emerged as one of the top-performing major tokens in 2023, boasting nearly a 600% increase in value over the past year, outpacing Bitcoin’s growth of 200%.

New York Initiates First-in-Nation Ban on New PoW Mining Operations Amid Environmental Concerns,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Ultramining_Eng,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"In a groundbreaking legislative move, the New York Senate has passed a bill aiming to curb the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining by enforcing a ban on new proof-of-work (PoW) mining operations. This decisive action places New York at the forefront of U.S. states in addressing the high energy consumption associated with blockchain technology, particularly Bitcoin mining. The legislation, which now awaits the governor's approval, seeks to pause the establishment of new PoW mining facilities for two years, especially targeting those not powered by 100% renewable energy, according to Xperttimes.
The controversy surrounding PoW mining centers on its substantial electrical power requirements, which have raised alarms over carbon emissions and environmental degradation. Senators endorsing the bill emphasize the urgent need to mitigate these environmental impacts, reflecting a broader shift towards sustainability in the digital currency realm. This move could signal a transformative period for the industry, urging a pivot to more energy-efficient mining practices such as proof-of-stake (PoS).
New York's stance on cryptocurrency mining is particularly significant given its status as a hub for such activities, thanks to its reliance on 50% renewable energy sources. However, critics argue that the bill overlooks the industry's progress towards greener energy solutions, with reports indicating that a significant portion of Bitcoin's network energy consumption now stems from clean sources.
The broader implications of New York's legislation extend beyond state lines, potentially influencing the national and global cryptocurrency mining landscape. As environmental concerns become increasingly central to the discourse on blockchain technology, New York's pioneering legislation could pave the way for similar initiatives across the U.S. and beyond, challenging the sector to innovate and adapt in pursuit of sustainability.",['BTC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab74de9c9d311fbae6394/

Analyst Predicts Explosive Growth for Altcoin and Meme Tokens,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Analyst Predicts Explosive Growth for Altcoin and Meme Tokens
Cryptocurrency markets’ popular analyst Bluntz has put forward a bullish expectation for an altcoin within the leading smart contract platform Solana (SOL) ecosystem, which reached triple digits in four weeks. Here are the details!
“Explosive Rally for WIF”
Known by the pseudonym Bluntz, the cryptocurrency analyst suggested on social media platform X that the popular meme token dogwifhat (WIF) is ready for an “explosive” rise after forming a V-shaped recovery on the hourly chart.
According to the data shared by the crypto analyst, the meme token has completed a three-wave pattern indicating the end of a correction according to Elliott Wave theory. Elliott Wave theory posits that the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern during the main trend and in a three-wave pattern during a corrective trend.
At the time of writing, WIF was trading at $2.08, marking a 994% increase from its February 7th price of $0.190. According to the analyst, WIF could gain up to 44% from its current level in the next leg of the rally. The analyst stated the following regarding the matter:

The next targets are $2.50 and $3, but you might not believe it.


 
PEPE Predictions
Bluntz also provided his predictions for Pepe (PEPE), a meme token that recorded triple-digit gains in the last 30 days. Noting that the meme token has not experienced a significant drop, he included the following statements:

PEPE hasn’t seen a sudden drop yet, it still looks corrective. We expect new rises from this level.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency analyst Bluntz foresees a significant rise for an altcoin within the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. He also indicated the potential for growth in meme tokens WIF and PEPE. He highlighted that WIF is showing signs of an uptrend based on Elliott Wave theory. At the time of writing, PEPE was trading at about $0.000008116, up approximately 780% over the past month. The 1000PEPE perpetual contract follows the Pepe token and represents 1000 PEPE tokens, as the symbol suggests.

Exploring the Influence of AI on Cryptocurrency’s Alternate Coins,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Exploring the Influence of AI on Cryptocurrency’s Alternate Coins
In a recent analysis by Coinbase, technology specialists have delved into the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the cryptocurrency sector, particularly on alternate coins known as altcoins. The study indicates that the perceived value of AI-related altcoins may be overstated due to heightened excitement rather than actual use, suggesting that their value is not backed by consistent market demand over the short to medium term.
Insights from Coinbase’s Crypto Analyst
The buzz around generative AI has echoed through the cryptocurrency market’s niche segments, but Coinbase’s market analyst, David Han, points out that the swift progression of AI tech has sparked doubts regarding the enduring viability of AI-focused altcoins. Han identifies a core issue being the contrasting aims of cryptocurrency—which leans towards decentralization—and the inherently centralized nature of the current AI landscape. He also notes the struggle of AI-crypto projects to secure investment, leading to a scarce capital flow in the niche.
Coinbase’s study unveils opportunities for the crypto-AI space, like improving Blockchain data comprehensibility and distributing AI’s centralized structures. However, Han underlines the uncertain trajectory towards a decentralized AI reality that many crypto enthusiasts hope for.
Notwithstanding the skepticism, AI altcoins have recently seen greater returns than industry giants such as Bitcoin, Nvidia, and Microsoft. This performance, as per Coinbase, is fueled more by general crypto market movements and AI-related media buzz than by fundamental value.
The narrative intertwining cryptocurrency and AI continues to gain traction, with successes in both markets reinforcing this trend. Yet, Coinbase advises that substantive and practical AI integration will be needed beyond mere decentralization efforts.
Ethereum Co-Founder’s AI Optimism
In a related development, Ethereum‘s co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed a positive stance on AI’s potential to mend Blockchain network issues, particularly through AI-driven audits in the Ethereum network. He stresses this could mitigate significant technical risks. As of the latest reports, AI altcoins hold an aggregate market capitalization of over $51 billion, distinguished by their support of AI-focused projects and services, such as AI-based trading systems and decentralized AI marketplaces.

Pioneering Strategic Partnership: Core Scientific’s $100M Deal with CoreWeave,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Ultramining_Eng,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"In an innovative shift within the cryptocurrency mining industry, Core Scientific has embarked on a strategic venture to diversify its revenue streams ahead of the imminent Bitcoin halving. The company has secured a lucrative $100 million deal with CoreWeave, an artificial intelligence startup, to provide state-of-the-art data center services, according to Cointelegraph.
Core Scientific, leveraging a Tier 3 data center in Austin, Texas, previously occupied by Hewlett Packard, will host CoreWeave’s infrastructure, delivering an impressive 16 megawatts of capacity. This facility is set to support high-performance computing (HPC) expansion, indicating a strategic pivot from traditional bitcoin mining to encompassing broader computational services. CoreWeave, backed by notable Wall Street firms including Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Fidelity, and valued at $7 billion as of December 2023, specializes in infrastructure for compute-intensive applications like machine learning, positioning itself at the forefront of AI technology.
The timing of this deal is critical, as it precedes the anticipated 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which will halve the block reward for miners, significantly impacting their revenue and potentially escalating operational costs. Historical data from CoinShares suggests that electricity costs per Bitcoin could constitute an even larger portion of miners' total cost structure post-halving. Core Scientific's venture into hosting services for CoreWeave not only showcases its adaptability but also its foresight in mitigating the financial implications of the halving through revenue diversification.","['AI', 'CORE', '2024', '2024', 'BTC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab6215d272771c7fef60e/

Having established that the altcoin market is on the verge of a fresh bull run, famous crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has predicted that the altcoin market, excluding Ethereum, will gain 40-60 percent in market capitalization in the coming months. In this regard, the TOTAL3 aims to add $300 billion to clinch around $1 trillion.
Meanwhile, Poppe expects Bitcoin price to consolidate before taking the liquidity above an all-time high. Furthermore, the halving frenzy amid the heightened demand from institutional investors will continue to fuel Bitcoin’s bullish outlook in the coming quarters.
Top Altcoins to Pay Close Attention 
With Ethereum (ETH) price eyeing to rally above $4,000 and retest its all-time high after more than two years of bear market, large and mid-cap altcoins led by Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Ripple-backed XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and Cardano (ADA) are likely to follow suit.
Some of the top altcoins to pay close attention to in the upcoming bull run include Chainlink (LINK), Uniswap (UNI), and Polygon (MATIC). Moreover, they have inked notable integrations and attracted significant investors’ attention due to their network development. 
For instance, the Uniswap Foundation proposal to enable revenue sharing with the UNI holders received overwhelming support in the temperature check vote with over 55 million UNI.","['ETH', 'RLY', 'UNI', 'FND', 'AVAX']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab5169e5b5547d0d02a82/
Hut 8 Mining Corp Entangled in Securities Lawsuit Amidst Operational Challenges,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Ultramining_Eng,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"Hut 8 Mining Corp, a key player in the blockchain sector, is currently navigating turbulent waters following a series of allegations that precipitated a notable decline in its stock value on the Nasdaq. Triggered by accusations from JCapital, a firm known for short selling, Hut 8's management has been thrust into a challenging predicament, leading to a significant downturn in investor confidence and stock prices, according to Coingape.
The company is now facing a securities class action lawsuit aimed at recuperating losses for shareholders who were impacted between November 9, 2023, and January 18, 2024. This period witnessed a stark plunge in Hut 8's stock price, culminating in a dramatic drop from $7.12 to $2.16 on January 19, following the publication of JCapital's critical report. This report not only questioned the company's merger with US Bitcoin (USBTC), valued at $725 million, but also hinted at potential insider trading and criticized the undisclosed significant stake held by a related party in the merger, suggesting possible investor detriment.
In response, several law firms have stepped forward, offering to represent investors in class action suits against Hut 8. These firms, leveraging federal securities laws, argue that Hut 8 and its executives failed to provide honest financial disclosures, directly contributing to the company's declining share value. Amidst these allegations, Hut 8 firmly denies all claims, attributing the negative report to a deliberate misinformation campaign aimed at benefiting short sellers at the expense of the company's stock price.
Compounding its legal troubles, Hut 8 announced the closure of its mining facility in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. This decision, driven by disruptions in power supply and rising energy costs, underscores the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency mining industry, particularly amidst the current energy crisis. The facility's closure is part of Hut 8's strategic effort to mitigate external pressures and sustain operations in a volatile market.
The unfolding situation with Hut 8 highlights the complexities and risks inherent in the cryptocurrency mining sector, especially as companies navigate legal, operational, and market challenges. As Hut 8 contends with the class action lawsuit and strives to adapt its business strategy, the outcome of these developments could have lasting implications for the company and its stakeholders.",['BTC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab5133c5ea62458a87dbe/

Aevo + Ribbon Finance (RBN)
The analyst talked about the next altcoin on his list, Aevo + Ribbon Finance (RBN). Despite its recent price increase, he thinks it’s still undervalued. He explained how Ribbon is rebranding to Aevo, a decentralized exchange for trading futures.

Crypto Capital Venture has opened up about the significance of paying attention to the Solana chart for all crypto holders, including Bitcoin enthusiasts. According to the analysis, Solana’s performance is often a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market, especially during bullish cycles.
He thinks the market is starting a good time for Bitcoin. He compares it to when Ethereum started going up in November 2020. Even though it might seem like prices are too high, there could still be a lot of room for them to go up.
Solana’s Price pattern suggests that prices might go up more. He thinks it could reach $235, which is much higher than now. He also talks about how Solana returns to a zone where prices might increase again. He expressed excitement over Solana’s recent breakout and sustained uptrend, highlighting its implications for altcoin investors.
Referencing past predictions made on October 31st, 2023, when Solana was priced at $38, the video recalled forecasting a significant surge in Solana’s value. Since then, Solana has skyrocketed to $146, showcasing remarkable growth compared to other altcoins like Cardano, valued at 74 cents at the time of the prediction.
Analyzing the current market trends, the video points out the similarities between Solana’s recent breakout and previous patterns observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum charts. While Bitcoin experiences consolidation after a massive rally, Solana’s upward momentum remains strong, indicating potential opportunities for further growth.
He compares this to what happened with Bitcoin recently. Bitcoin went up a lot, then slowed down when it reached a certain point. He says it’s important to watch how different cryptocurrencies are doing and not just focus on one. Even though there might be ups and downs, he’s positive about the future of cryptocurrencies like Solana.","['ETH', 'SOL', 'BTC', 'WHEN']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab3e69e5b5547d0d02a7a/
Exploring the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Altcoins,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Exploring the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Altcoins
Technology experts continue to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in various business sectors. A recent report by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase suggests that the value potential of altcoins related to artificial intelligence might be exaggerated, with many lacking sustainable demand in the short and medium term, and their price increases being more hype-driven than based on actual usage.
Coinbase’s Report on AI Altcoins
The rise in popularity of generative AI has also become apparent in the sub-ecosystems of the cryptocurrency market in recent years. However, according to Coinbase’s research analyst David Han, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of most AI altcoins.
According to Han, one of the most significant challenges faced by crypto-AI projects lies in the fundamental differences between the two technologies. Han notes that while cryptocurrency projects generally aim for decentralization, the current artificial intelligence world largely depends on centralized components and data sources. He also added that many projects in this field struggle to attract investors, leading to insufficient capital distribution in the crypto-AI ecosystem.

Coinbase’s report identifies two potential opportunities for the crypto-AI sector: enhancing Blockchain data for human-readable transactions and analyses, and decentralizing the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han emphasizes that a decentralized AI future, as envisioned by many in the cryptocurrency industry, is not guaranteed, highlighting the general uncertainty surrounding the future of the AI industry.
Despite the cautious outlook, many artificial intelligence altcoins have recently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributes this to market sentiment driven by broader crypto market trends and supported by related AI news headlines.
While the crypto-AI narrative continues to strengthen due to ongoing positive trends in the cryptocurrency market and the AI sector’s superior performance, Coinbase suggests that achieving meaningful adoption will require more than just decentralizing AI components.
The Crypto-AI Narrative Gains Support from Vitalik Buterin
In addition to Coinbase’s observations, Ethereum‘s co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed optimism about using artificial intelligence to fix errors in Blockchain networks. Buterin highlighted the potential of AI-powered audits to detect and correct problematic code in the Ethereum network, emphasizing its importance in reducing the “biggest technical risk” to the network.
As of March 8, AI altcoins have a total market value of $51.18 billion. These altcoins stand out for facilitating various AI-based projects, applications, and services, including decentralized AI marketplaces, AI-powered trading algorithms, and AI-driven decentralized autonomous organizations.

2024 Crypto Rally: Ignited by Bitcoin Surge!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-08 04:00:00,"In the turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to reign as the undisputed king. However, as 2024 dawns, a burning question plagues the minds of savvy investors: Will the current Bitcoin rally extend to riskier alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? With over 13,000 tokens in circulation, the potential for exponential gains is undeniable, but so are the associated risks.
Bitcoin, the Potential Driver of a Ripple Effect on Altcoins
Historically, Bitcoin’s movements have often had a significant impact on the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, when the queen of cryptos experiences a meteoric rise, investors tend to turn to riskier assets, hoping to multiply their gains. 




Consequently, a ripple effect dynamic comes into play, leading to a generalized increase in altcoin prices. However, this correlation is not an absolute rule, and many factors come into play, such as the fundamentals of underlying projects and market trends.
The Risky Gamble of Altcoins: Between Tempting Opportunities and Formidable Traps
Despite the inherent risks, altcoins continue to attract a bold segment of investors, drawn by the potential for astronomical returns. Indeed, some little-known tokens have experienced stratospheric surges following a Bitcoin explosion, turning modest investments into considerable fortunes. 
However, the downside is just as harsh, with numerous promising projects having collapsed, swallowing the savings of their investors. This duality underscores the critical importance of thorough analysis and strict risk management in this highly volatile market segment.
The Harbingers of a Potential Altcoin Rally
Despite the uncertainties, certain indicators could herald the imminence of an altcoin rally. These include a sustained increase in trading volumes, a resurgence of interest from institutional investors, and growing adoption of altcoins’ real-world use cases. 
In addition, technological advancements, such as the emergence of new decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or the integration of scaling solutions, could catalyze a new wave of investments in promising altcoins. Not to mention the current Bitcoin rally.
While Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, the question of a potential high-risk altcoin rally remains open. Although the prospects for dizzying gains are enticing, investors must remain vigilant against the formidable traps lurking in this tumultuous segment. Whether it is an avalanche of gains or a vertiginous fall, the future of the altcoin market remains unpredictable and exciting.","['2024', 'RLY', '2024', 'BTC', 'WHEN']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eab173e9c9d311fbae638b/

 The cryptocurrency market has seen notable increases across major digital coins in recent trading sessions. Bitcoin, the market leader, neared the $68,000 mark, with Ethereum surpassing $3,900. This upward trend was not limited to the top players, as other prominent cryptocurrencies including Solana, XRP, and Cardano also enjoyed substantial gains in value. 
Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead Market Rally
 Bitcoin recently maintained its stance above the $67,000 threshold, touching a high of $67,129.10, which translates to a 1.75% upswing. Despite this, its trading volume saw a drop of 32.72%, amounting to $44.65 billion. Ethereum, on the other hand, climbed 3.17% to reach a price of $3,901.20, though its trading volumes decreased by 36.46% to $21.70 billion. Binance Coin also jumped by 9.69%, reaching a price of $470.13, and Solana’s price soared by 4.22% to $144.54, with XRP climbing to $0.6268. 
Performance of Meme Tokens and Other Altcoins
 Altcoins such as Cardano revealed a moderate rise of 0.63%, achieving a trading price of $0.7391. Meme tokens were part of the rally as well, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu increasing by 8.19% and 8.02%, respectively. Pepe Coin experienced a remarkable 13.55% surge, hitting a price point of $0.000007731. Floki, another meme-centric token, was among the highest gainers, recording a 35.16% hike to $0.0001705 and achieving an intra-day peak of $0.000173.

 The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a broad sell-off, leading to a significant price decline for many digital assets, including Cardano (ADA), which saw a drop of over 10% on March 5th. Despite this downturn, ADA has displayed signs of a strong comeback with a consistent upward trajectory over the past five weeks, increasing by 78% from $0.447 to $0.79. 
Cardano’s Strategic Market Position
 Market analysts point out that Cardano’s price movement indicates a possible reversal pattern, known as a cup and handle breakout, that began with surpassing the critical resistance level on March 1st. This pattern has been accompanied by rising trading volumes, suggesting robust buying activity and investor confidence in ADA’s potential for sustainable growth. 
 Despite the overall market volatility, Cardano has maintained a resilient performance, particularly after breaking through a significant resistance level of $0.68. In the last few days, ADA has recorded an 8% gain, trading at around $0.75. Should this bullish pattern hold, Cardano could see its value soar to a prospective high of $1.146, translating to a notable 51% increase from its current price. 
Future Prospects Amid Market Uncertainty
 While the bullish outlook for ADA is promising, investors remain cautious as a dip below the $0.68 mark might signal a weakening bullish momentum and instigate a price correction. Nevertheless, the resilience of Cardano’s price action presents a beacon of optimism in a turbulent market, even as other cryptocurrencies struggle to regain their footing. 
 As the market continues to face challenges, Cardano emerges as a digital asset demonstrating not only recovery but also the potential for further gains. However, investors are advised to watch for fluctuations and consider the $0.68 level as a crucial indicator of Cardano’s continued bullish trend.

Popular cryptocurrency analyst Martini Guy delved into his updated altcoin tier list, evaluating the potential of seven different cryptocurrencies. Investors are eyeing opportunities across various altcoins as the market experiences a potential dip. Here’s a breakdown of the coins discussed and their growth potential:
Vanar Chain:
The analyst sees Vanar Chain as a promising project with major upside potential. Highlighting its recent developments, including transitioning from an ERC-20 token to launching its own blockchain, he expects substantial growth. With a focus on entertainment and mainstream adoption, Vanar Chain aims to revolutionize data storage in the industry. He places Vanar Chain in the 100x category, suggesting a potential tenfold increase in value.
Orange
Positioned as a low-market-cap ERC-20 token, Orange attracts attention due to its association with the burgeoning BRC2 space. Backed by a strong Bitcoin community and potential Binance listing, Orange promises significant growth. Martini Guy places Orange in the 1000x category, indicating a bullish outlook for its future performance.
Cornucopia
Initially conceptualized as a metaverse project, Cornucopia has evolved into a well-designed gaming platform. Supported by the Cardano Foundation, Cornucopia stands out as a promising project in the metaverse space. He predicts Cornucopia’s potential for 100x growth, driven by its strong backing and innovative approach.
Polkadot
Despite recent market fluctuations, he remains optimistic about Polkadot’s long-term prospects. With its improved ecosystem and growing adoption, Polkadot is poised for substantial growth in the next bull market. Martini Guy suggests Polkadot could perform between the 20x and 50x categories, outperforming many other projects.
Ethernity
Ethernity aims to connect fans with leading brands through digital collectibles, catering to the growing demand in the NFT space. Despite its current price, he believes Ethernity has the potential to achieve significant growth. The analyst assigns Ethernity to the 50x category, recognizing its potential in the digital collectibles market.
Veloce
Veloce, associated with Veloce Esports, presents an intriguing opportunity due to its low market cap and association with a prominent esports network. Despite early investor exits, Martini Guy views Veloce as undervalued and primed for growth.","['2024', '2024', 'VANRY', 'ERN', 'ORG']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eaaf18e9c9d311fbae6389/
Cardano’s Steady Growth and Price Predictions,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Cardano’s Steady Growth and Price Predictions
Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a sudden sell-off wave that brought down the price of Bitcoin (BTC) from its all-time high of $69,000. The overall supply spread to altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), which recorded a drop of over 10% on March 5th.
Signs of Accumulation in ADA
However, experts analyzing daily charts also foresee a critical rejection indicating that buyers are defending their new support levels. Accumulation at the market’s bottom could be a significant signal of a sustainable recovery. The native cryptocurrency of the Cardano ecosystem, ADA, has shown steady growth over the past five weeks, rising from $0.447 to $0.79.
This 78% increase, supported by occasional pullbacks and rising volume, could reflect ADA’s price witnessing sustainable growth. Analysis of the daily chart for the cryptocurrency suggests that this rise could be the development of a bullish reversal pattern known as the cup and handle breakout, which started with the neckline break on March 1st.

Cardano Price Forecast
The mentioned breakout could indicate that buyers are emerging from a long accumulation phase and a new rally is on the horizon. Despite recent selling pressure in the market, the ADA price has shown sustainable performance above the breached neckline of $0.68. In the last two days, the altcoin has seen an 8% increase, trading at $0.75. Under the influence of this pattern, buyers could potentially move the Cardano price to a theoretical target of $1.146, marking a 51% potential growth.
Contrary to these assumptions, a break below the $0.68 level could signal a weakening of the upward momentum and trigger a new correction trend. Consequently, despite the sudden drop in Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market remains hopeful with Cardano’s steady growth and performance above the resistance defined by the cup and handle breakout pattern, but experts warn that a break below the $0.68 resistance could trigger a correction trend.

Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) Looks To Enrich Early Investors as Stacks (STX) and NEAR Protocol Appreciate With General Market Uptrend,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"
TLDR

Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) promises the best gains for its early investors with exciting developments in line.
Market experts have predicted that Stacks (STX) will witness a price growth of 68% in 2024.
Analysts believe NEAR Protocol (NEAR) can cross the $6 mark in 2024.

After a grand launch on DEX and CEX platforms, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) aims to enrich its early investors, standing as the best ICO of 2024. On the other hand, Stacks (STX) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) have appreciated as the market experiences a broader upswing.
Let’s explore the reasons behind optimistic expert projections for $RBLZ, STX, and NEAR to determine the best crypto to invest in!
$RBLZ Teases Exciting Developments Following Its DEX Launch
In a market where Stacks (STX) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are experiencing appreciable growth alongside a general uptrend, Rebel Satoshi is setting the stage for enriching its early investors with its innovative approach and promising developments, standing as one of the altcoins to watch ahead.
At its core, Rebel Satoshi is more than just another digital currency; it's a movement against the status quo. This revolutionary project has a goal to democratize financial services, making them available to anyone, anywhere, without the need for intermediaries.
The journey to this point has been spectacular, with Rebel Satoshi's public presale achieving a 150% price increase. Starting at an ambitious $0.010 per $RBLZ in the Early Bird Round, the price surged to $0.025 per $RBLZ by the end of Recusants Round 5, resulting in a sold-out presale and over $2.5 million in funding.
Following its presale success, Rebel Satoshi has launched on the Uniswap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and the Tier 1 Centralized Exchange (CEX) Coinstore at $0.025 per $RBLZ. This strategic move by Rebel Satoshi is anticipated to significantly boost its market performance, drawing even greater investor interest.
Moreover, Rebel Satoshi has announced its intention to build an expansive ecosystem that promises to engage its community further. The future appears bright with the imminent release of the Rebel Satoshi Arcade, numerous fun games, and exclusive merchandise available later this month.

Crypto Experts Predict STX’s Price Will Surge by 68% in 2024
Stacks ventured with a bullish trajectory as 2024 commenced, surpassing the $2 mark in a remarkable rally after the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs. However, STX retreated below $2 by January's end. In February, STX experienced a resurgence, soaring to $3.38.
Recently, LunarCrush, a prominent social media analytics platform, highlighted the surging social activity surrounding Stacks.
The platform reported a remarkable increase in social interactions for STX, attributing it to the growing excitement surrounding Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions. Social metrics, including posts, creators, and social dominance, exhibited significant upticks, underscoring increased community engagement. So, is STX the best crypto investment option now?
Considering the optimistic outlook for Stacks and its ongoing price rally, experts foresee STX surging by 68% to reach a price point of $4.87 by 2024, driven by the anticipation of an upcoming bull run.
However, STX's price trajectory is anticipated to remain below $4.03 throughout 2024 if bearish sentiments surface in the market.
Market Analysts Believe NEAR Can Surge Beyond $6 in 2024
NEAR Protocol encountered hurdles as 2024 commenced, experiencing a considerable 22.7% price decline in the first month. However, February brought a reversal of fortunes as NEAR Protocol rebounded, registering a remarkable 37% surge and concluding the month with a price of $3.87.
Reflexivity Research released its NEAR Q4 Overview report, shedding light on several key milestones scheduled for 2024. These include advancements such as the next stage in Nightshade sharding, meta transactions, zero-balance accounts, and a Global Storage proposal, among others, underscoring NEAR Protocol's commitment to ongoing innovation.
Taking into account NEAR Protocol's recent performance, its forthcoming developments, and the positive trajectory observed, experts envision NEAR surpassing the $6 mark to reach $6.53 by the conclusion of 2024.
However, if bearish market conditions prevail, NEAR is anticipated to maintain stability around $5.41 throughout 2024.

The fear of missing out (FOMO) on NUGX's offerings has increased the buying pressure on this platform. The presale performance confirms this, raising over $2.6 million shortly.

NuggetRush (NUGX): Pioneering Growth and Innovation in the Meme Coin Sphere
NuggetRush has experienced tremendous growth since its presale began, attracting industry specialists looking for the top crypto coins for huge gains. Due to its popularity as a meme coin, its $0.019 presale has soared to the launchpad round. The results show a big jump of 90% from the first stage. Only about 24% of the tokens are left because of the low presale­ prices and the FOMO in the weekly giveaways. 
This new DeFi project has sold over 208 million tokens during the presale. Also, users could see a higher uptick to $0.02 upon launch, suggesting NUGX is a profitable meme­ coin. One reason for this growth is its trustworthiness and transpare­ncy. The smart contract gets the thumbs up from Solidproof. The­ technology of the Ethere­um blockchain supports this, inviting a large group of investors to join in.  
Another element driving this development is incorporating cryptocurrency, mineral mining, and gold mining into a P2E game. This new DeFi project contains a gameFi model that converts virtual goods into real incentives like money and gold. Given its rapid expansion and outstanding characteristics, NuggetRush is well-positioned to take the lead in the industry by 2024.

Dogecoin (DOGE): Surging to Prominence Amidst Whale Action
Dogecoin originated as a joke and has become a top-valued coin as it enhances online transactions, charitable donations, and content creator tips. This altcoin continues to astound the market with a consistent upward trend, maintaining its position as the largest meme coin in the world. DOGE's progress is primarily due to the influence of whales in its ecosystem.
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Leading the Pack with Bullish Momentum
Shiba Inu is a meme coin launched as a rival of Dogecoin, or ""Doge-Killer."" It has a strong community of supporters who actively promote and engage with the project. This altcoin is attracting heavy bullish sentiment in the indices as the token has received an influx of new investments. By surging nearly 40% within the past 30 days, SHIB will be a profitable meme coin in 2024. 
Pepe (PEPE): Rising Star with Redistributive Rewards 
Pepe is another top meme coin poised to rule the space this year. It has gained widespread recognition among investors, leading to a surge in market capitalization to more than $2.26 million. The main advantages of PEPE are that it allows for a zero-tax policy, long-term staker incentives through redistribution, and a burn mechanism that preserves the token's scarcity. 
Akita Inu (AKITA): The Buzz of Blockchain Airdrop
Akita Inu is a top meme coin praised for its quick and inexpensive transactions. Its blockchain airdrop generated excitement throughout the cryptocurrency community. The distribution targeted active wallets, awarding them tokens to increase participation and network activity. This airdrop also catalyzed more interactions with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized applications. 
ShibaPup (SHIBAPUP): A Rising Meme Coin with Promising Features and Future Projections
ShibaPup feature­s a unique play-to-earn game and substantial community backing. This meme coin has seen impre­ssive growth since the start of the­ year, hinting at potential success. A re­cent price forecast sugge­sts SHIBAPUP could reach $267.19 by 2050, affirming this trend.
Final Thoughts
NuggetRush, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Akita Inu, and ShibaPup are the 6 top meme coins poised to dominate the 2024 market. NUGX distinguished itself with a community-owned game, a zero-tax system, and a staking mechanism that offers 20% annual rewards to holders.

Binance Coin Announce Rewards for 2024 Hackathon
On February 5, Binance Coin announced that BNB Chain Hackathon 2024 applications are now open. According to Binance Coin, $10,000 will be distributed to qualifying submissions. To qualify, ensure that you deploy your dApp (decentralized application) on Binance Coin Smart Chain, use open source for universal access, and ensure your contract has more than two transactions during the hackathon.
Thanks to an engaged ecosystem, Binance Coin surged in late February. On February 23, BNB traded for $376.51. A week later, BNB gained 8.46% and traded for $408.21. As one of the best altcoins in the crypto industry, experts believe BNB will record another price surge soon. BTC halving will occur in April, and the Binance exchange will record massive network activity during this period. Therefore, BNB will likely trade for $460.52 in the coming weeks.  
ADA Records Double-digit Surge in Late February
Recently, the Cardano Foundation launched a community engagement program called ‘Let’s Talk Cardano.’ By 18:00 CET on March 5, Let’s Talk Cardano will host crypto experts from Clarity DAO (a Cardano-focused decentralized analytics platform). Justin Schreiner (Product Lead at Clarity DAO) and Logan Panchot (Core Member of Clarity DAO) will discuss leveraging DAO formation and community building on Cardano.
As a result of consistent ecosystem progress, ADA recorded a double-digit price in the last week of February. On February 23, ADA traded for $0.582. A week later, ADA gained 16.75% and traded for $0.679. According to crypto experts, leading altcoins like BNB and ADA will surge in April due to the upcoming BTC halving. As a result, ADA will likely surge and trade for $0.895 during this period.
Crypto Analysts Predict Possible 900% Price Surge for $ROE in 2024
One of the best talents of profitable crypto traders is the ability to identify new DeFi projects with high-ROI potential. Interestingly, some investors found Borroe Finance in 2023 and invested over $3 million on the platform. For context, Borroe Finance is an AI-powered fundraising marketplace that allows web3 businesses to raise instant cash by minting future earnings into trending NFTs and selling them at a discount to their audience.
$ROE is in its fourth presale stage, and the token is selling for $0.019. After all presale stages conclude, $ROE will list the best crypto exchanges and sell for $0.040. According to crypto analysts, this bullish $ROE price movement will deliver a 110.5% ROI to early investors. Furthermore, these analysts predict that $ROE will enjoy speedy market adoption after listing, gain up to 900%, and likely trade for $0.190 by December.

Analyst Weighs in on SEC Chair’s Comparison of BTC With Roller Coasters,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"
Gary Gensler called crypto a “highly speculative asset class.” 
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said that volatility isn’t a bad thing for Bitcoin.
Gensler also refused to comment on the approval of a spot ETH ETF in the US.

Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has warned investors regarding investing in Bitcoin (BTC), comparing its volatility with a roller coaster in an interview with Bloomberg. 
Notably, Gensler was asked about Ether’s (ETH) categorization as a security or commodity. “Any one of these crypto tokens is about the facts and circumstances as to whether the investing public is anticipating a profit based on the efforts of others,” said the SEC Chair. 
Gensler, who has been termed a “political liability,” acknowledged that his agency has multiple ETH ETF filings but refused to comment on the same while adding: 

This is a highly speculative asset class. One could just look at the volatility of Bitcoin in the last few days … You really should be conscious as the investing public that this is a bit of a roller coaster ride on these volatile assets.

Top 6 Altcoins Poised For 6x Rally In 2024 – Predicts Crypto Analyst Lark Davis,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"The post Top 6 Altcoins Poised For 6x Rally In 2024 – Predicts Crypto Analyst Lark Davis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Cryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis has recently shared his views on six altcoins that he believes hold potential for 2024. In a recent video, Davis delved into the narratives and developments surrounding each project, shedding light on why investors might want to keep them on their radar.
Jupiter
Davis started by discussing Jupiter, the largest exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain. Despite experiencing a slight slump post-airdrop, Davis remains bullish on Jupiter due to its upcoming Launchpad and Perpetual swaps Dex, which already handle nearly a billion dollars in daily volume. Moreover, Jupiter’s founder has promised fee sharing for token holders in the future, adding to its allure. 
Beam
Next on Davis’s list is Beam, a gaming hub and incubation platform that has been making waves in the gaming sector. With a focus on token burns, strategic partnerships, and a lineup of promising games set for release in 2024, Beam presents an enticing investment opportunity, particularly in the booming gaming industry within the crypto space.
Polkadot
Davis turned his attention to Polkadot, highlighting the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade as a potential catalyst for renewed excitement around the project. With improvements in the parachain model and the prospect of token burns driving upward price movements, Polkadot could regain its momentum in the market. 
Puff
Puff, described as a “gamified meme coin,” caught Davis’s eye due to its association with Mantle Ethereum and its unique airdrop mechanism. With a storyline unfolding over three months and the opportunity for token holders to earn rewards in ETH, Puff presents an intriguing investment proposition, particularly for those interested in community-driven projects.
Parcel
Parcel, a Solana-based real estate market exchange, allows investors to participate in global property markets on-chain. With the ability to long and short real estate assets and growing traction within the Salana ecosystem, Parcel presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to real-world assets within the crypto space.
Mixmob
Rounding off his list, Davis discussed Mixmob, a gaming coin on Solana backed by industry veterans. With a low market cap and significant partnerships, including one with Star Wars, Mixmob has ambitious plans for its main game release and is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for gaming-related cryptocurrencies.","['RLY', '2024', 'CCY', '2024', 'DOT']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eaabb25d272771c7fef5fd/
SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Options Trading Until April 24,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"The post SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Options Trading Until April 24 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to take more time to think over BlackRock’s request to offer options trading on a Bitcoin ETF that tracks the actual price of Bitcoin. This kind of trading would let investors bet on the future price of Bitcoin without owning it directly. The SEC has moved the decision date to April 24. BlackRock’s request isn’t the only one waiting for an answer. The SEC is also taking its time with similar requests from Cboe Exchange, Inc. and Miax Pearl LLC.
A Closer Look at the Decision-making Process
The SEC made this decision public on March 6, stating that it needs extra time to consider the rule change suggested by Nasdaq. Nasdaq ISE had put forward a proposal on January 9, to allow trading options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust. This proposal got published for everyone to see and comment on by January 25, and five comments were received.
According to the rules, the SEC had 45 days from the publication date to decide. They could extend this to 90 days if needed, which they did. The original deadline was March 10, but they’ve moved it to April 24. The SEC stated that this extension ensures they have enough time to review the proposal and make a thoroughly informed decision.
BlackRock’s Bitcoin Strategy Expands
While waiting for the SEC’s decision, BlackRock is not sitting idly. The company has filed new documents with the SEC to buy more Bitcoin ETFs. They plan to include these in their Global Allocation Fund. This filing indicates that BlackRock is looking to invest in Bitcoin ETFs officially listed and traded on recognized national exchanges.
BlackRock is a big player in the Bitcoin ETF market. Their current Spot BTC ETF is performing exceptionally well, leading a surge in interest for Bitcoin ETFs. The past week saw unprecedented performance levels for Bitcoin ETFs, with records broken nearly daily. The price of Bitcoin has been holding steady at around $68,000 since the beginning of the week, signaling strong market performance.","['SEC', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'APRIL', 'ETF']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eaabb02070793d42b9efa9/
"5 Best Altcoins to Invest in Right Now March 7 – THORChain, Akash Network, EOS",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"As the market continues to rally, investors are filling their portfolios with promising tokens, many showing significant gains. With major market players appearing out of reach, altcoins are becoming increasingly attractive for savvy investors looking to enter the market intelligently.
Nonetheless, choosing the right altcoin requires dedication and thorough research. This article aims to streamline the decision-making process by identifying several standout altcoins investors should consider.
5 Best Altcoins to Invest in Right Now
As the altcoin season nears, THORChain, Akash Network, and EOS emerge as standout options, boasting unique features and promising market prospects. Concurrently, cryptocurrencies rebound following Bitcoin’s retreat from its recent all-time high.
1. THORChain (RUNE)
Thorchain is showcasing signs of entering the bull run with increased optimism in the market outlook. Notably, its performance above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) demonstrates a robust recovery trend since late 2023. Moreover, Thorchain has also drawn the attention of HODLers, anticipating significant price growth.
Furthermore, Thorchain’s price chart showcases volatility since the beginning of the year. This volatility indicates substantial fluctuations in buying and selling pressures within the coin’s market. Meanwhile, Thorchain has recorded a Year-to-Date (YTD) valuation surge of 23.79%, signaling increased buying activity within the crypto space.

RUNE exhibits a bullish trajectory on market metrics, hinting at positive price movements shortly. Technical indicators align with this sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also displays a consistently green histogram and ascending averages. Also, the Cross EMA 50/200-day curve indicates a bullish trend, suggesting the potential for significant price actions ahead.

What happens next:
1) 100% of nodes update: V1.128 code path executed2) 60,000,000 $RUNE moved into RESERVE and insta-burned3) Lending Caps opened ~$100m in Collateral Space opened4) Resume onboarding collateral at a rate of $1m/day
Who's ready? https://t.co/qfN1VVWTC2
— THORChain (@THORChain) March 6, 2024


Therefore, experts suggest that in the event of continued bullish momentum, Thorchain’s price is expected to challenge its previous high of $7.310 in the coming days. Conversely, a reversal in trend could lead to a loss of momentum, which could drive the price to test its support level at $5.360 within the upcoming week.
2. Akash Network (AKT)
Decentralized cloud computing is gaining traction, shifting focus to Akash Network for its innovative approach. On this note, the market is growing as AKT’s sentiment is bullish. This, combined with increased trading volumes, has raised the greed score to 82.
Over the last 30 days, Akash Network has experienced 18 green days, constituting 60% of the period. It is presently trading near its cycle high at $6.24. Meanwhile, AKT printed 14.91% in the last 24 hours, reaching $6.12.

The remarkable performance continues over the past year, with a staggering 1,510% increase in price, outperforming 97% of the coins. Additionally, Akash Network maintains a positive trajectory, trading 506.79% above its 200-day simple moving average of $1.0128.

NVIDIA earnings for Q4 just surpassed expectations by a massive margin, a healthy sign that the demand for GPUs remains strong.
Akash is supporting this sustained demand by providing permissionless access to GPUs to power AI, machine learning, and decentralized applications.
— Akash Network (@akashnet_) February 21, 2024


Considering its innovative features and strong community backing, Akash Network’s AKT Coin is poised for further growth. However, cautious optimism prevails as our price prediction suggests a potential maximum price level of $4.82 by the end of 2024. 
3. Kava (KAVA)
The proposal to launch Wagmi Leverage Products on MetisL2 and KAVACHAIN has been successfully approved with an overwhelming 86% majority vote. The deployment on Kava scheduled for next week begins with deploying and activating leverage on the Metis network today.
Meanwhile, Kava Chain began the year positively, achieving a significant milestone on January 1, 2024, as the KAVA token inflation reached zero. This move marked the first hard-capped, highly decentralized Proof-of-Stake layer-1 blockchain. Over half of the 1 billion KAVA token supply is securely locked in the community-controlled Strategic Vault.
Kava Chain’s development journey showcases its consistent growth and innovation. Moreover, it reflects adaptive leadership and a relentless drive for evolution within the Web 3 space. In 2024, Kava Chain is all set to impact on-chain finance significantly. 

This is driven by strategic innovation and a renewed commitment to decentralization and community expansion. Furthermore, Kava’s price prediction is positive, with the consistent green candlesticks in the last month signaling a bullish outlook. In line with this, the coin transaction is high, with a greed score of 81, indicating confidence. 
Presently, the KAVA price stands at $1.033250, printing an intraday increase of 6.86%. Kava’s closing prices have bettered the opening price in 21 of the past 30 days. In addition, the coin has high liquidity based on its market cap, demonstrating robust market performance. 

🔊 Attention Kava Chain users 🔊
All BEP3 assets will be migrated to Binance Smart Chain around April 30th to streamline asset transfers, improve security, and pave the way for more efficient financial operations.

— Kava (@KAVA_CHAIN) March 7, 2024


Over the past year, Kava has seen a 22% price increase and trades 31.13% above the 200-day simple moving average at $0.788257. Backed by strong fundamentals and a dedicated crypto community, Kava has the potential to achieve significant milestones in the future.
Equally, collaborations with other networks could influence the KAVA Coin to surpass the $2.43 mark by 2024. In a positive crypto market scenario, the average price of the Kava Coin is anticipated to hover around $2.20 by the same year. This presents an exciting opportunity for investors seeking growth in the crypto space.
4. EOS (EOS)
The recent announcement from Yves La Rose, CEO of EOS, regarding the intention to cut EOS’s total supply by half has sparked significant interest among crypto investors. Consequently, this decision has propelled the price of EOS to $1.2102, indicating a positive response from the market.

While Bitcoin aims for the $68,000 mark, EOS’s optimistic news has contributed to its current price hovering around $1.25. Moreover, the Fear & Greed Index of 81 suggests a prevailing investor confidence despite the ongoing adjustment phase.
Meanwhile, the potential impact of EOS’s supply cut on its market valuation is eagerly anticipated. Speculation suggests a surge in price beyond $2 billion, which could drive the coin’s price over $2, attract more investors, and reshape its market dynamics.

Hence, experts and investors closely monitor EOS’s developments, anticipating a new price equilibrium. Additionally, if the reduced supply is well-received, EOS may experience sustained price growth, further enticing investors.
5. eTukTuk (TUK)
The eTukTuk presale has reached a significant milestone, surpassing $1.8 million in funds raised, indicating strong investor interest. The project, centered around green initiatives and AI-driven efficiency, offers an appealing opportunity for investors to purchase and stake tokens with a promising 137% APY. Currently priced at $0.02775, there’s potential for future value surges as the project advances.

The eTukTuk protocol optimizes transportation routes using TUK tokens, thereby reducing traffic congestion and fuel consumption and promoting sustainable transport practices.

Crypto Options Alert: Bitcoin and Ethereum Set for Significant Expiry Event,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"

  Cover image via U.Today


A significant event is on the horizon with the impending expiry of 29,000 Bitcoin (BTC) options and 270,000 Ethereum (ETH) options, according to data provided by Greeks.live. This event, set to take place on March 8, encompasses options with a total notional value of over $3 billion. 
The crypto market has been notably volatile, experiencing its highest fluctuations in nearly a year, with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $69,000 before experiencing a sharp 10% decline.
The surge in options trading, driven by the U.S. money-driven spot bull market, shows growing investor interest.
Understanding options expiry 
An options contract offers the buyer the right to purchase (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) the underlying asset at a predetermined price, known as the strike price before the contract expires on a specified date (expiry date).
The put-call ratio is a key indicator used to gauge market sentiment. It is calculated by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options. 
A ratio below 1, such as 0.86 for BTC and 0.55 for ETH, suggests that more call options (bets that the price will rise) are being traded than put options (bets that the price will fall), indicating a generally bullish sentiment among investors. However, the value below 1 also suggests a level of caution, as the market is not overwhelmingly bullish.
The concept of ""max pain point"" refers to the price level at which the largest number of options (both calls and puts) would expire worthless. For investors holding these options, it represents the worst-case scenario where they gain nothing from their investment in the option contracts.
In this context, the max pain points are $60,000 for BTC and $2,950 for ETH. Traders and market analysts often pay attention to these levels as options approach their expiry dates because significant numbers of traders may act to avoid the max pain point. 
Bitcoin price consolidation 
Bitcoin's price trajectory is in the spotlight, with market analysts and top traders like Jake Wujastyk predicting its readiness to establish new record highs. 
After a swift V-shaped recovery from a recent sharp decline, Bitcoin's price has stabilized, showing strong indications of an upcoming bullish run. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around the $67,000 level, with a market cap hitting a new high of $1.33 trillion, reflecting growing investor confidence and adoption. 
The ABC pattern formed during its consolidation phase suggests a solid base for potential price jumps, with forecasts suggesting a reach toward the $76,000 mark.","['ETH', 'BTC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eaaa6d5d272771c7fef5fb/
Solana Surges Towards $150 Milestone,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Solana Surges Towards $150 Milestone
In recent market activity, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) has experienced a significant increase, ascending an additional 5% in a day to reach a price level of $145. The altcoin’s community is abuzz as the price nears the pivotal $150 mark, a level that has not been attained since January 16, 2022.
Market Momentum Builds for Solana
Data from Santiment, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, indicates that the $150 threshold is a crucial point for SOL, and the market is watching to see if this momentum continues. Despite a lack of the fervent enthusiasm known as FOMO, historical trends in the crypto market suggest that skepticism can often fuel further price gains.
Market experts are predicting a robust surge for Solana, with some suggesting a potential rise above $200. Strengthening this outlook is the active trading of Solana-based memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF), along with increased interest from major investors after Pantera Capital’s announcement of a $250 million fund to purchase SOL assets from the insolvent exchange FTX.
Optimism for SOL Amid Record High Predictions
Despite SOL currently trading 43% lower than its all-time high of $259 seen in November 2021, cryptocurrency analysts like Altcoin Sherpa are confident about its future growth. They believe SOL has the potential to not only return to its previous high but to set new records during the current market cycle.
Altcoin Sherpa tempers expectations of SOL reaching a thousand dollars in the next bull run but maintains that the altcoin stands to see considerable growth. The market is closely observing Solana’s performance as it approaches the $150 level, which could be a turning point for its price trajectory.

Philippines Advances Plans for Wholesale CBDC with Project Agila,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"In a recent press conference held on March 6, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) shared further insights into its ambitious plans to explore the wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) of the Philippines. 
Mamerto Tangonan, the BSP’s Deputy Governor for Payments and Currency Management Sector, unveiled details about the ongoing pilot project named Project Agila, set to conclude by the year’s end.
As reported earlier by TheCoinRise, the Philippine central bank is strongly in favor of stablecoins and believes that they can revolutionize the existing monetary system and enable “affordable and faster” cross-border transfers. 
Philippines Advances on Project Agila
Describing Project Agila as a “learning exercise,” Tangonan emphasized the BSP’s vision for a future where access to securities and investment instruments is democratized. He envisions a scenario where individuals in Philippines, irrespective of their financial status, can not only dream but also own securities. The goal is to enable smaller issue sizes and significantly lower fees, making investment opportunities accessible to every citizen. 
It is important to note that the country is taking crypto very seriously and recently banned Binance for operating illegally.
Participation from Six Domestic Banks
Six prominent domestic banks—BDO Unibank, China Banking Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Union Bank of the Philippines, and Maya Philippines—are actively participating in the wCBDC pilot alongside the BSP. The primary focus of the project is the seamless transfer of funds among these banks using wCBDC.
Tangonan shed light on the broader aspirations of the BSP, stating, “But we also like to see if this wholesale CBDC can be used for higher value-adding services like securities settlement.” This hints at the potential expansion of wCBDC functionality beyond basic fund transfers to more intricate financial services.
Philippines is Only Considering a wCBDC
BSP Governor Eli Remolona, speaking in February, clarified the central bank’s cautious approach, emphasizing that they are only considering a wCBDC. This decision stems from concerns about bank disintermediation and other challenges associated with the issuance of a retail CBDC. Remolona emphasized that the proposed wCBDC would not operate on a blockchain.
Exploring Benefits of CBDCs
The Philippines initially expressed interest in issuing a CBDC in 2020. Following a positive initial assessment of a wCBDC, the BSP announced its pilot tests, known as Project CBDCPh, in 2022. The current Project Agila marks a significant step forward in the country’s exploration of the potential benefits and applications of a wholesale central bank digital currency.
Notably, in 2023, the Philippines participated in a pilot study involving the Digital Dollar Project, Western Union, and BDO Unibank to explore the use of retail CBDC in remittances. The study revealed the potential for cost reduction, increased transparency, and heightened competition but faced challenges in transaction speed due to remittances arriving after working hours.

"Wealthy Cardano Business Man Acquires Option2Trade (O2T), Value $0.0091",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"A wealthy Cardano (ADA) businessman has acquired a significant stake in Option2Trade (O2T),  a new crypto venture valued at $0.0091. This strategic move is a  testament to his belief in O2T’s potential and a clear signal of the  growing interest among high-net-worth individuals in emerging  cryptocurrencies that promise innovation and growth. The investment  demonstrates the growing interest among savvy investors in the dynamic  world of cryptocurrency.A Visionary Move: Diversifying with O2TThe decision by the Cardano (ADA) businessman to invest in Option2Trade (O2T) stems from a strategic  desire to diversify his investment portfolio beyond the well-established  ADA ecosystem. Recognizing Option2Trade’s (O2T) low entry price of  $0.0091 as a gateway to substantial future returns, he sees the value in  getting involved in the early stages of a platform that aims to  revolutionize the trading experience for its users. This move reflects a  broader trend among affluent investors looking to capitalize on  promising new ventures within the expansive crypto market.Why Option2Trade (O2T) Stands OutOption2Trade (O2T) distinguishes itself by offering a wide range of  asset classes, including Forex, cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities,  and indices. This broad offering is designed to attract a diverse group  of traders, from novices to seasoned veterans, enhancing the user  experience within social trading groups. The platform’s focus on  supporting traders to have diversified portfolios aligns with the  Cardano (ADA) businessman’s investment philosophy, highlighting the  importance of versatility in achieving long-term success in the volatile  world of crypto trading.The Allure of a $0.0091 ValuationThe valuation of Option2Trade (O2T) at $0.0091 per token played a crucial role in capturing the Cardano  (ADA) businessman’s attention. This price point not only makes  Option2Trade (O2T) an accessible investment option but also hints at the  potential for exponential growth as the platform develops and expands  its user base. Investing at such an early stage allows him to maximize  his potential returns, a strategy that has likely contributed to his  success as a Cardano (ADA) investor.O2T: A Promise of Technological InnovationOne of the core reasons behind the Cardano (ADA) businessman’s  interest in Option2Trade (O2T) is the platform’s commitment to  leveraging technological innovation to enhance trading outcomes.

Coinbase Addresses the Exaggerated Surges in AI Cryptocurrencies,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"
Coinbase asserts that the recent surges in AI cryptocurrencies are exaggerated.
Research analyst David Han stated that AI platforms can disrupt the industry.
Han points out the challenges faced by AI projects such as Akash Network, which is experiencing declining supply.

In a recent report, Coinbase asserted that the prevailing hype and surge in cryptocurrencies related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is exaggerated. David Han, a research analyst at Coinbase, pointed out the rapid changes in the AI sector, commenting that crypto-focused platforms are “uniquely positioned to disrupt” the industry.
According to CoinGecko data, the AI crypto projects have soared to $26 billion this year. About 30% of these surges occurred in a single day following the rise in Nvidia stock, an industry leader. Today, the AI crypto coins boast a market cap of $25.4 billion, up 5% in 24 hours.
Han asserted that AI tokens usually have positive impacts from the broader crypto industry’s bullish sentiments and the circulation of AI-related news. Reiterating that the attention given to AI tokens these days is overstated, he added,

Solana’s Price Surge Gains Momentum,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Solana’s Price Surge Gains Momentum
In an environment of notable price movements, the popular altcoin Solana (SOL) has made a serious climb. SOL has continued its ascent, gaining an additional 5 percent in value over the last 24 hours, reaching the $145 level. As the popular altcoin approaches the critical threshold of $150, excitement within the community is growing.
Solana’s Price Rally
According to analysis by leading on-chain data provider Santiment, the $150 level is a significant turning point for SOL. This level was last seen on January 16, 2022, and the popular altcoin is approaching this level for the first time since then.

Despite the rising expectations surrounding Solana, analysts point to a lack of enthusiasm typically associated with the fear of missing out (FOMO), which could potentially lead to a softening of the rally. However, historical trends in the cryptocurrency market have shown that doubt often acts as a catalyst that drives prices up. With Solana’s price on the verge of the critical $150 price level, market observers are waiting for more developments to measure the price trajectory.
Many market analysts are forecasting a strong rally for Solana, with some predicting it will surpass $200. The strong trading activity of Solana-based memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) is providing significant support for the anticipated price rally of SOL. Particularly, the interest of major market players in purchasing SOL at current prices has increased following the announcement of Pantera Capital‘s plan to raise $250 million to buy all SOL assets of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
Analysts Expect SOL to Refresh Record Highs
Despite the current upward momentum, SOL is still priced 43 percent below its previous all-time high (ATH) of $259 reached in November 2021. Nevertheless, experienced cryptocurrency analyst Altcoin Sherpa maintains optimism about SOL’s future performance, suggesting it could surpass its previous ATH and set new records in the current market cycle.
While Altcoin Sherpa notes that SOL’s price reaching a thousand dollars in the next bull run as claimed is unlikely, he emphasizes that the altcoin has significant potential for a substantial increase.

South Korea’s Bitcoin ‘Kimchi Premium’ Breaks 2-Year Record,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-08 05:00:00,"
South Korea’s Bitcoin price premium hits 10%, signaling renewed retail investor interest.
Retail dominance fuels Bitcoin liquidity surge in South Korea despite subdued institutional investment.
Ki Young Ju’s analysis suggests Bitcoin’s price is unlikely to dip below $46,376, offering reassurance to investors.

Bitcoin is reaching new heights in South Korea, with its price premium achieving a 2-year record of 10% in the country, according to the co-founder and CEO of the crypto-analytics firm CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju. The rise in trading volume reflects that there is a renewed interest among Korean individual investors, which might be a signal that the market dynamics are also changing.

SEC pushes back decision to open up options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its decision on whether to approve options trading on spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — which could open the door for more institutional capital into Bitcoin.
In a March 6 filing, the SEC extended its time to respond to Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange on their bids to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs.
It also delayed deciding on Nasdaq’s bid to offer options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saying the delay ensures it has “sufficient time to consider” its request.
The exchanges all filed to list Bitcoin ETF options on Jan. 25, and the SEC faced its first decision deadline on March 10, as U.S. securities laws give it 45 days to decide or defer a decision on the matter.
Its deferral gives the agency another 45 days — its maximum 90 days under the law — to come to a final decision, which the SEC noted was April 24.

Options are derivative products that give traders leverage and let them make directional bets on the market.
If a trader thought Bitcoin’s price would rise, they could pay a premium, buy a “call option,” and agree to buy 1 BTC at today’s price in a month’s time while putting down less money than would be needed to buy 1 BTC.
If Bitcoin rises over the month, the trader could use their option, buy Bitcoin at the lower price, and maybe sell it for a profit. If it sinks, they’d likely just let the contract expire and forfeit the premium paid.
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein called for the approval of options for Bitcoin ETFs last month, claiming they “contribute to a robust and healthy market.”
VettaFi analyst Dave Nadig told CNBC in January that once Bitcoin ETF options markets are live, “you’re going to start seeing all sorts of hedge fund players in the space.”
Nadig said those who weren’t “speculating on crypto directly in the crypto ecosystem are now going to have some to play with.”

The SEC approved 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs to start trading on Jan. 11 — the final day it had to decide on approval after months of delaying them.
Traders have brimmed the ETFs with cash — nine of the new ETFs, excluding Grayscale’s, which was converted to an ETF, had $25.87 billion in assets under management, according to March 6 BitMEX Research data.
The SEC is now having to decide on seven spot Ether (ETH) ETFs. Analysts predict the agency is holding back until May 23 to approve them all on the deadline for VanEck’s application.
Multiple leveraged Bitcoin ETFs are before the SEC, with asset manager Direxion filing for five inverse and long spot Bitcoin ETFs in January alongside ProShares’ five leveraged Bitcoin funds and REX Shares’ six leveraged ETFs.

"AI tokens are more hype than value right now, says Coinbase analyst",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"While technologists continue to explore artificial intelligence (AI) use cases in all business verticals, a Coinbase research report suggests that AI-related tokens may be over-hyped right now, at least in the short and medium term. 
The rising popularity of generative AI spurred niche crypto sub-ecosystems over the last couple of years. However, Coinbase research analyst David Han believes that the rapid changes in AI “make us cautious” of the long-term sustainability of most AI tokens. 
One of the primary challenges with crypto AI projects lies within the core of both technologies. While crypto projects often aim for decentralization, the current AI offering relies heavily on centralized components and data sources, argues Han.
In addition, most projects in the niche have failed to attract investors — resulting in under-indexed capital allocation. 
The report highlights two opportunities for the crypto AI ecosystem — improving the blockchain data for creating human-readable transactions and analysis and helping decentralize the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han said:

 “A decentralized AI future, as it is currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed — in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.”

Despite the negative outlook, many AI tokens haverecently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributed this to the market sentiment built by the broader crypto market and supported by related AI news headlines.

The crypto AI narrative could grow even stronger amid the continued constructive crypto market and the outperforming AI sector. However, Coinbase suggests that driving “meaningful adoption” will require more than just decentralizing AI components. 
It is important to note that the AI ecosystem is currently in its nascency and will have to “understand the underlying trading narrative” at the very least, eventually providing a comparable alternative to today’s crypto assets.

On Feb. 19, Buterin shared his excitement for AI-powered auditing to identify and fix buggy code in the Ethereum network, describing it as the “biggest technical risk” to the network.
AI tokens cumulatively hold a market capitalization of $51.18 billion as of March 8, according to Crypto.com data. These tokens serve AI-based projects, applications and services, such as decentralized AI marketplaces, AI-powered trading algorithms and AI-driven decentralized autonomous organizations, to name a few.

"Shiba Inu Kian Digemari dan Diidolakan, Mampukah Gantikan Posisi DOGE?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,blockchainmedia.id,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"Pasar kripto mengalami fenomena luar biasa dengan token Shiba Inu (SHIB), baru-baru ini menunjukkan lonjakan adopsi yang belum pernah terjadi sebelumnya.   Data on-chain menyoroti peningkatan signifikan dalam jumlah alamat baru setiap hari, mencapai tingkat hampir 20 kali lipat rata-rata bulan sebelumnya. Pertumbuhan ini merupakan bukti semakin popularnya dan penerimaan SHIB sebagai pemain kunci dalam dunia kripto. 
Shiba Inu Kian Digemari   Memecoin utama ini mengalami peningkatan signifikan dalam alamat barunya bulan ini. Alamat baru, dalam konteks mata uang kripto, mengacu pada dompet atau akun yang dibuat di blockchain yang belum pernah digunakan sebelumnya.   Bitcoinist melaporkan bahwa, jumlah harian yang tinggi dari alamat-alamat tersebut menunjukkan masuknya pengguna baru ke jaringan SHIB, yang menunjukkan minat yang kuat dan potensi untuk mengadopsi kripto ini.   Peningkatan adopsi yang pesat ini merupakan pertanda positif bagi Shiba Inu, menandakan basis pengguna yang sehat dan berkembang.   Sebaliknya, rendahnya jumlah alamat harian baru akan menyiratkan berkurangnya minat terhadap token, dan hal ini tidak terjadi di sini. Lonjakan alamat baru adalah bukti nyata dari meningkatnya minat komunitas dan investor terhadap SHIB, yang memperkuat posisinya di pasar kripto yang kompetitif.      Grafik yang menggambarkan tren alamat baru harian untuk Shiba Inu selama sebulan terakhir dengan tajam menggarisbawahi pertumbuhan ini. Saat ini, jaringan tersebut menyambut sekitar 8.400 pengguna baru setiap hari, sebuah angka yang secara mencolok menyoroti meningkatnya popularitas token tersebut.   Lonjakan adopsi ini terjadi bersamaan dengan kenaikan harga Shiba Inu yang signifikan, menjadikannya peluang investasi yang menarik bagi mereka yang ingin mendiversifikasi portofolio mata uang kripto mereka.   Beberapa hari sebelumnya, jaringan ini menyaksikan pencapaian yang luar biasa, dengan 21.000 alamat baru bergabung dalam satu periode 24 jam. Puncak ini, hampir 20 kali lipat rata-rata harian yang diamati pada bulan Februari, menurut data dari IntoTheBlock, menekankan meningkatnya minat terhadap SHIB.   Implikasi yang lebih luas dari lonjakan adopsi ini sangat penting bagi prospek jangka panjang Shiba Inu. Basis pengguna yang berkembang memberikan landasan yang kokoh bagi kripto, yang berpotensi menstabilkan kehadirannya di pasar dan memastikan kegunaan dan relevansinya di masa depan.   Meskipun pergerakan harga secara langsung mungkin tidak berkorelasi langsung dengan tingkat adopsi, komunitas yang lebih besar dan lebih aktif akan meningkatkan kemungkinan penggunaan berkelanjutan dan retensi nilai dari waktu ke waktu.   Kebangkitan Shiba Inu yang tiba-tiba sebagian disebabkan oleh kenaikan harga Bitcoin baru-baru ini, yang telah menanamkan kepercayaan di kalangan investor untuk mengeksplorasi aset-aset yang lebih bergejolak.   Antusiasme baru ini telah mendorong Shiba Inu mencapai performa luar biasa, dengan nilainya meningkat lebih dari 264 persen dalam sebulan terakhir. Lintasan pertumbuhan yang luar biasa ini digambarkan dengan jelas dalam grafik terlampir, yang menunjukkan momentum bullish aset.   Sebagai perbandingan, Dogecoin, memecoin asli dan pesaing langsung Shiba Inu, juga mengalami pertumbuhan namun belum bisa menyamai kecepatan yang ditetapkan oleh Shiba Inu.   Perbedaan kinerja ini telah menyebabkan perombakan daftar kapitalisasi pasar kripto, dengan DOGE dan SHIB kini diposisikan berdekatan satu sama lain.      Dalam basis mingguan, kinerja Shiba Inu sangat luar biasa, mencatatkan kenaikan lebih dari 128 persen, sedangkan pertumbuhan Dogecoin tidak terlalu besar, dengan keuntungan kurang dari 20 persen. Kontras ini menggarisbawahi kekuatan dan momentum Shiba Inu saat ini di pasar.   Jika tren ini terus berlanjut, ada kemungkinan nyata bahwa Shiba Inu dapat melampaui Dogecoin dalam kapitalisasi pasar, sebuah skenario yang akan menyoroti perubahan signifikan dalam preferensi investor dan dinamika pasar dalam ruang memecoin.    ","['SHIBA', 'MEME', 'DOGE', 'SHIB', 'MEM']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65eaa109c06a1631354e2cbf/

Nigeria’s SEC Strengthens Crypto Regulations Via New Rules,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"
The SEC has issued new regulations on the licensing, registration, and inspection of VASPs.
The revision of operating standards coincides with Binance now under investigation.

In an effort to better control the operations of cryptocurrency companies, the Nigerian SEC has issued new regulations. Reportedly, this new set of rules is an effort to reduce instances of digital currency fraud and money laundering. The revision of operating standards coincides with the fact that Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is now under investigation in the nation.
Moreover, as per reports, the SEC has just issued new regulations on the licensing, registration, and inspection of virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The initiative’s stated goal is to safeguard the capital market against “criminals being registered as operators” and to improve market regulation generally.
Ongoing Feud
Concurrent with the implementation of these new regulations, Nigeria is further consolidating government control over the digital asset market. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, recently made news when it announced its intention to cease providing services in Nigerian Naira (NGN) due to heightened scrutiny in the nation.
Binance seems to have been singled out more during the recent crackdown on crypto exchanges in the nation, perhaps due to its past legal issues in the country.
Moreover, Binance likewise made an effort to assist its customers in safeguarding their investments in light of Nigeria’s recent crypto crackdown. Reiterating its commitment to working with local authorities, the firm showcased its efforts to ensure regulatory compliance across.
But it encountered an immediate obstacle when, in the course of the above regulatory motion, the officials of its Nigerian branch were reportedly apprehended. Concerns about an imminent crackdown on cryptocurrencies in Nigeria were heightened when Nigerian officials refuted any remarks suggesting Binance would be subject to a $10 billion punishment.

Bitcoin Cashback Incentives Introduced by Travala for Premium Travelers,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"With the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) as a valuable asset, crypto-friendly travel service Travala.com is introducing a BTC cashback scheme to reward its premium customers.
Those who reached the Smart Diamond level of the loyalty reward program run by the AVA Foundation’s blockchain platform may take advantage of Travala’s new incentive system, according to an announcement.
The new reward scheme is driven by Bitcoin’s fame, its limited supply, and its status as a precious digital asset, according to Travala.com CEO Juan Otero.
Th CEO stated:

“Bitcoin is here to stay, and it’s now becoming more appealing to mainstream audiences, thanks to the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.”

The availability of Bitcoin cashback incentives on travel reservations, according to Otero, increases the attractiveness of using bitcoin for everyday purchases. Additionally, Travala has verified that members will get their rewards no later than 24 hours after their journey ends.
Members will have the freedom to use their Bitcoin rewards as they choose. They may use their Bitcoin to buy further travel goods on the platform or to withdraw it to another service, exchange, or wallet.
Travala.com accepts Bitcoin as one of its top three payment options. Almost nine percent of all reservations for trips booked via the platform use Bitcoin as payment. For transportation, lodging, and activities in 2023, tourists paid about $5 million in bitcoin.
As an alternative to traditional Web2-based programs, Travala promotes cryptocurrency-based cashback schemes. Bitcoin, according to the business, might assist cashback providers lower chargeback fraud risks and expenses connected with conventional payment rails.
The CEO of Travala thinks that the BTC and AVA rewards programs might bring in new users to the Web3 ecosystem using Bitcoin. Cashback, loyalty, payment savings, and restricted access advantages are distributed by the AVA Foundation, a blockchain-based rewards network that utilizes its native AVA token.
Having a Travel Tiger NFT and 2,500 AVA tokens staked to activate Smart Diamond membership makes Travala’s BTC cashback program rather exclusive.There are a limited amount of 1,000 Travel Tiger NFTs available, thus the rewards system will only be open to a certain number of passengers. The NFTs are collectible utility tokens that are randomly created and mint on the Ethereum blockchain. According to OpenSea’s market statistics, Travel Tiger’s floor price is 2.6 Ether, which is worth roughly $9,800 right now.","['NFT', 'BTC', 'DMD', 'AVA', 'CEO']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea94273c5ea62458a87d8c/
Polygon Recovery Hints at New Bull Run – Can MATIC Hit $7.50?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"
Polygon (MATIC) is showing strength above $1 amidst positive sentiment in the crypto market.
It broke out of a significant triangle pattern and surpassed long-term resistance.
Analysts suggest it could retest its all-time high of $2.92 soon and potentially reach $6 to $7.50 in the future

Polygon (MATIC) appears ripe to capitalize on renewed crypto market optimism as its price holds resiliently above $1. This recovery comes as MATIC staged a convincing breakout above several key technical markers that previously capped upside moves.
Foremost among these was a decisive triangle pattern that dominated most of Polygon’s price action since its meteoric 2021 rally up to record highs near $2.92. This multi-month consolidation finally gave way over the past week as MATIC crossed above trendline resistance.
According to some analysts, MATIC is mirroring similar price dynamics that kicked off its parabolic uptrend in 2021. Its weekly relative strength index (RSI) now stands perched above 60 with plenty of runway before hitting overbought readings. This mimics the same RSI build that preceded MATIC’s historic 10,000% explosion two years ago.



Polygon breaks long term resistance
Additionally, MATIC’s long-term resistance trendline was shattered for the first time since 2021, opening the pathway towards levels last seen during its peak bull run hype. With fundamentals also strengthening across Polygon’s layer-2 ecosystem, the stars seem aligned for a renewed surge.
Barring any shock black swan events, MATIC appears en route to retesting its all-time high around $2.92 in the coming months. But some experts have set their sights even higher if Polygon’s network activity continues to gain steam.
One potential scenario sees the parallels from previous cycles playing out similarly, with MATIC possibly topping out between $6 and $7.50 next cycle, representing a 500% upside from today’s price. However, bulls need to maintain support above $1.15 and confirm solid weekly closes before such euphoric predictions materialize.
In summary, MATIC’s resilience and key technical breakouts set the stage for its next face-melting rally. But with crypto markets still choppy, savvy holders likely have their finger on the trigger to secure profits on any vertical spikes. Nevertheless, Polygon seems ready to reward those committed for the long haul.",['MATIC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea9426c06a1631354e2cae/
Zircuit Staking Program Breaks $500M TVL And Adds Ethena Integration,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"George Town, Grand Cayman, March 7th, 2024, Chainwire
Zircuit, a zk rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level, today announced its staking program has surpassed $500M in TVL. Currently in testnet phase, Zircuit is poised to hit a mainnet TVL on day one that surpasses major blockchains such as Linea, Manta, Mantle, Near, Scroll, Aptos, and zkSync.
Next week, Zircuit will integrate Ethena, adding to its growing list of supported protocols for Zircuit Staking. Users who stake USDe with Zircuit will earn Zircuit Points and 7x Shards (Ethena points). Ethena is a crypto-native solution to a yield-bearing synthetic dollar fully collateralized and freely composable onchain. Other protocols in the program include Renzo, Kelp, Etherfi, Lido, Swell, Eigenpie, and Liquid Collective. 
Points programs have become a rising trend in crypto, offering a new way to incentivize users who contribute to a protocol. Zircuit Staking is an innovative program that allows users to deposit ETH, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) to earn Zircuit Points. Through the staking program, users can earn Zircuit points on top of any staking yield or points they are already earning. Users who opt-in to migrate their assets to the Zircuit Mainnet when it goes live are rewarded the most. Users can withdraw at any time and keep the points and yield earned, as ETH isn’t hard-locked like Blast or Mantle. 
After spending over a year and a half conducting L2 research, the Zircuit team created an L2 with a built-in AI-enabled sequencer that protects users by monitoring the mempool for malicious transactions. In comparison to typical security efforts that focus on the application and smart contract levels, Zircuit brings sequencer-level security (SLS). This means that every transaction on Zircuit will go through low-level security checks resulting in a more secure chain for projects and end users. Zircuit is also fully EVM-compatible, offers greater efficiency, and provides users with cheaper and faster transactions.
Backed by Pantera Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom, Zircuit is currently in testnet phase with mainnet expected to come later in 2024. To participate in Zircuit Staking, users can visit: https://stake.zircuit.com/

"Ethereum Consolidates Near Pivotal Point: Will ETH Hit $4,000?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-08 06:00:00,"
Ethereum (ETH) is in a critical phase, with its price confined between $3,800 and $4,000.
Analysts note ETH’s movement within a symmetrical triangle pattern, suggesting a forthcoming breakout.
Breaking above $4,000 could lead to ETH challenging highs near $4,270, while failing to breach $4,000 may result in deeper pullbacks

Ethereum finds itself at a critical technical juncture this week as its price oscillates within a tight trading range bound by two key levels – $3,800 and $4,000. This period of equilibrium follows Bitcoin’s pullback from nearly hitting its all-time high, creating market uncertainty on whether existing support and overhead resistance levels will hold.
Zooming into Ethereum’s short-term price action, analysts highlight how ETH bounced between parallel Bollinger Band limits as it approaches the apex of a large symmetrical triangle pattern. This setup typically precedes high-volatility breakouts.
A decisive move beyond the current $3,800 – $4,000 bounds could set the tone for Ethereum’s next directional move. An upside breakout above $4,000 seems plausible given Bitcoin’s renewed push towards record highs. This may propel ETH to challenge local highs around $4,270 initially.



Can Ethereum hit $4,000?
However, failing to breach the psychological $4,000 barrier risks deeper pullbacks as sellers look to capitalize on fading bull momentum. Any drops below the $3,800 support threaten to invalidate Ethereum’s bullish structure and expose the next downside targets around $3,550 and $3,375.
In effect, Ethereum’s market sits at a knife’s edge between firmly continuing its young 2024 uptrend or witnessing pumps fizzle out into bearish chart patterns. Traders keenly anticipate whether optimistic buying volume can outweigh the nagging macro uncertainty that temporarily capped Bitcoin’s gains.
Of course, calling precise directional and price levels for such a volatile asset as ETH proves challenging. But its reaction following recent consolidation may set its trend for the pivotal period ahead. As long as Bitcoin avoids steep falls, odds seem to favor Ethereum’s bulls breaking above $4,000 and motoring higher next week.","['ETH', '2024', '2024', 'BTC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea9427b8024d06250b18f5/
US prosecutors to continue tussle for Do Kwon’s extradition: Report,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"United States prosecutors will contest the latest Montenegrin high court ruling that has placed Terraform Labs’ Do Kwon headed for South Korea extradition.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) told Bloomberg that it “continues to seek Kwon’s extradition in accordance with relevant international and bilateral agreements and Montenegrin law,” per a March 7 report.

 “The United States appreciates the cooperation of the Montenegrin authorities in ensuring that all individuals are subject to the rule of law.”

South Korea and the U.S. filed extradition requests for Kwon in March 2023 but have since been fighting over who gets the first bite of the apple.
Kwon, who served as Terraform Lab’s CEO, was set to be extradited to the United States following a Feb. 21 ruling by the High Court in Podgorica.
However, two weeks later, the Montenegro Appeals Court cited “significant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure” and overturned the lower court’s ruling, putting Kwon back toward a South Korean trajectory.



Source: @Crypto_Crib_ on X


According to Montenegro’s judicial system, the U.S. may appeal to the Supreme Court of Montenegro, which sits above the Montenegro appeals court as the highest court in the country.
Kwon faces eight charges in the U.S., including fraud and market manipulation, stemming from the $40-billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In South Korea, he faces allegations of fraud and breaches of capital markets law.
Kwon’s lawyers have previously indicated he would rather be extradited to South Korea to be closer to his family, where he reportedly faces a 40-year prison term.
Cointelegraph reached out to the DOJ for further comment.

South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September 2022. He didn’t surface until March 2023, when he was arrested by Montenegrin authorities for traveling with a fake Costa Rican passport.
Kwon had a brief stint on bail but served at least four months in prison over the passport incident and was then moved to extradition custody.

"Ada Sinyal Koreksi untuk Harga Bitcoin, Apakah Bull BTC Sudah Lelah?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,blockchainmedia.id,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"Data on-chain yang berkaitan dengan Bitcoin (BTC) telah mengungkapkan wawasan menarik tentang perilaku pasar, adanya sinyal koreksi yang menanti di depan.   Analisis terbaru menyoroti metrik tertentu yang mencapai ambang batas yang, dalam konteks historis, sering kali menjadi pendahulu penyesuaian dalam nilai pasar Bitcoin.   Diskusi ini melibatkan interaksi kompleks antara nilai pasar BTC, nilai nyata yang dipersepsikan di antara pemegang jangka pendek, dan tren pasar yang lebih luas yang mempengaruhi harga kripto ini. 
Sinyal Koreksi untuk Harga Bitcoin   NewsBTC melaporkan bahwa, d pusat analisis ini adalah rasio Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), sebuah indikator canggih yang membandingkan kapitalisasi pasar Bitcoin dengan kapitalisasi realisasinya.   Kapitalisasi realisasi menyajikan model penilaian yang lebih mendalam, menunjukkan bahwa nilai sebenarnya dari setiap Bitcoin yang beredar berbeda dari harganya di pasar, lebih cenderung ke harga di mana terakhir kali ditransaksikan di blockchain.   Pendekatan ini mengasumsikan bahwa transaksi terakhir yang melibatkan Bitcoin kemungkinan besar menandai instansi terakhir dari transfer kepemilikan, sehingga menetapkan dasar biaya untuk kripto tersebut.   Akibatnya, kap realisasi mengagregasi dasar biaya dari semua Bitcoin, menawarkan perspektif yang lebih berakar tentang investasi kolektif yang dialirkan ke Bitcoin.   Saat ini, harga Bitcoin diamati secara signifikan lebih tinggi, sekitar 40 persen,dari dasar biaya pemegang jangka pendek, menurut wawasan dari Maartunn, manajer komunitas CryptoQuant Belanda.   Perbedaan ini telah menarik perhatian di antara analis pasar dan investor, mengingat implikasinya yang potensial terhadap lintasan harga Bitcoin.   Pemegang jangka pendek, yang untuk analisis ini didefinisikan sebagai investor yang telah memperoleh Bitcoin dalam 155 hari terakhir, mewakili segmen pasar yang dinamis.      Perilaku dan pola investasi mereka mempengaruhi rasio MVRV secara signifikan, terutama ketika memeriksa pergerakan harga Bitcoin melalui lensa ini. Data historis menunjukkan bahwa periode di mana harga Bitcoin melonjak di atas dasar biaya rata-rata pemegang jangka pendek sering kali mengarah ke koreksi pasar.   Tren yang diamati ini menyoroti aspek kritis dari dinamika pasar Bitcoin, seiring dengan bertambahnya margin keuntungan bagi investor, begitu pula godaan untuk merealisasikan keuntungan ini, berpotensi menyebabkan peningkatan tekanan jual.   Meskipun rasio MVRV yang tinggi untuk pemegang jangka pendek menandakan keuntungan bersih dan dapat dilihat sebagai indikator bullish, itu juga menimbulkan kekhawatiran tentang inflasi harga yang tidak berkelanjutan dan kemungkinan terjadinya pullback korektif.   Selain itu, perjalanan BTC melalui periode volatilitas signifikan semakin memperumit narasi. Setelah mencapai puncak baru yang belum pernah terjadi sebelumnya di atas ambang US$69.000, Bitcoin sejak itu mengalami fluktuasi, dengan harganya berfluktuasi sekitar US$67.700.   Volatilitas seperti itu tidak hanya mempengaruhi sentimen investor tetapi juga mempengaruhi keputusan strategis baik bagi partisipan pasar jangka panjang maupun jangka pendek.     ","['BTC', 'ADA']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea8f89e9c9d311fbae636b/
"Analis Ini Prediksikan Harga DOGE Bakal Melesat 550 Persen, Ini Alasannya",COIN_MARKET_CAP,blockchainmedia.id,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"Lintasan harga Dogecoin (DOGE) telah menarik perhatian para investor dan analis, dengan proyeksi yang menunjukkan potensi lonjakan harga hampir 550 persen selama siklus pasar saat ini.   Optimisme ini didasarkan pada kombinasi faktor yang berkontribusi pada apa yang disebut oleh analis kripto terkenal, Altcoin Sherpa, sebagai perdagangan yang relatif aman. 
Harga DOGE Bakal Melesat 550 Persen   Dengan pengikut lebih dari 200.000 di platform X (sebelumnya Twitter), analisis Altcoin Sherpa menyoroti daya tembak DOGE, sebuah istilah yang merangkum posisi uniknya sebagai raja meme dari kripto dan dukungan yang diterima dari tokoh berpengaruh seperti Elon Musk, CEO Tesla dan SpaceX.   https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1765184155007045958?   Crypto Globe melaporkan bahwa, ketertarikan Elon Musk terhadap Dogecoin telah jelas melalui banyaknya pengakuan dan dukungan untuk token tersebut di media sosial dan petunjuk tentang integrasi potensialnya ke dalam usaha bisnisnya, termasuk platform media sosial X.   Dukungan ini secara historis telah menyebabkan pergerakan harga signifikan untuk DOGE. Misalnya, pada November 2022, pengumuman Musk tentang platform yang mendukung pembayaran memicu spekulasi tentang inklusi Dogecoin dalam sistem pembayaran X, mendorong lonjakan harganya.   Musk sering menyatakan kesukaannya terhadap Dogecoin, menyebutnya mungkin sebagai kripto favorit saya, yang lebih lanjut memicu optimisme di antara para investor.   Meskipun ada pandangan positif, Altcoin Sherpa berhati-hati, mencatat ketidakpastian waktu untuk lonjakan yang diantisipasi ini.   Ia menyarankan bahwa bisa memakan waktu beberapa bulan untuk prediksinya menjadi kenyataan dan memperingatkan bahwa besarnya pengembalian mungkin tidak mengulangi keuntungan luar biasa yang terlihat selama bull run 2021, mengingat kapitalisasi pasar Dogecoin yang kini lebih besar.   Analisis tersebut menghadirkan Dogecoin sebagai opsi investasi yang relatif aman, didukung oleh komunitas yang kuat dan potensi untuk pertumbuhan substansial. Namun, Sherpa menekankan pentingnya investor menilai toleransi risiko mereka sebelum melakukan investasi.   Perbandingan antara DOGE dan ckripto lain, seperti Solana (SOL), tetap tidak pasti dalam hal rasio risiko/imbalan. Meskipun demikian, pola grafik Dogecoin yang menjanjikan, yang menunjukkan periode konsolidasi panjang diikuti oleh gerakan naik tajam, ditonjolkan sebagai indikator potensi keuntungan masa depan.   Sherpa menunjuk target harga spesifik untuk investor pantau, termasuk tanda US$0,20 dan US$0,35, memberikan konteks untuk harga perdagangan DOGE saat ini sebesar US$0,156.   Meskipun mengalami penurunan lebih dari 4 persen dalam periode 24 jam, Dogecoin telah melihat peningkatan sekitar 100 persen selama bulan lalu, menekankan volatilitasnya dan potensi untuk keuntungan cepat.   Secara historis, Dogecoin telah mengalami reli cepat dan signifikan, seperti yang dibuktikan oleh ledakan minat pencarian pada 2021 selama reli harga besar-besaran 10.000 persen.   Lonjakan popularitas ini, dari rata-rata 135.000 pencarian bulanan pada April 2020 menjadi 16,5 juta pada April 2021, mencerminkan kemampuan kripto untuk menangkap imajinasi publik dan minat investor.   Penciptaan Dogecoin pada 2013 sebagai lelucon ringan menyembunyikan dukungan investasi dan komunitas serius yang telah diperoleh selama bertahun-tahun.   Komunitas Dogecoin, yang dikenal dengan upaya filantropisnya, telah mengambil beberapa proyek amal, termasuk inisiatif terkenal pada 2014 yang mengumpulkan lebih dari US$25.000 DOGE untuk membantu tim bobsleigh Jamaika berpartisipasi dalam Olimpiade Musim Dingin di Sochi.","['DOGE', 'SHERPA', 'APRIL', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea8f893c5ea62458a87d8a/
"Pantera Siap Borong Rp3,9 Triliun Solana, Harga SOL Diprediksi Melesat ke US$1.000",COIN_MARKET_CAP,blockchainmedia.id,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"Pantera Capital, pemain utama di ruang investasi kripto dengan dana milyaran dolar AS, siap borong kripto Solana (SOL) senilai Rp3,9 triliun.   Pantera memulai langkah strategis untuk memanfaatkan aset-aset terganggu dari bursa kripto yang kini bangkrut, FTX, dengan meluncurkan kampanye penggalangan dana yang bertujuan untuk memperoleh koin SOL dengan harga diskon. 
Langkah Besar Pantera   Inisiatif ini, yang diberi nama Pantera Solana Fund, mengusulkan sebuah jalur investasi di mana investor memiliki kesempatan untuk memperoleh koin SOL dengan nilai hingga US$250 juta dengan harga yang jauh lebih rendah dari pasar, langsung dari harta kekayaan FTX.   NewsBTC melaporkan bahwa, strategi yang mendasari akuisisi ini menyoroti lanskap pasar kripto yang turbulen namun penuh peluang.   Solana, sebuah platform blockchain yang sangat dihargai karena kecepatan dan efisiensinya, telah melihatkoin SOL-nya fluktuatif dalam nilai di tengah-tengah keadaan pasar dan faktor-faktor ekonomi yang lebih luas yang mempengaruhi lingkup kripto.   Langkah Pantera Capital untuk membeli token ini dengan diskon menunjukkan tren yang lebih luas di mana perusahaan investasi berusaha untuk memanfaatkan penurunan pasar untuk potensi keuntungan jangka panjang.   Menurut Bloomberg, Pantera Solana Fund menawarkan proposisi unik kepada investor dengan memungkinkan mereka untuk membeli koin SOL dengan tarif yang 39 persen di bawah rata-rata 30 hari, atau dengan harga yang ditentukan sebelumnya sebesar US$59,95.   Pendekatan ini tidak hanya menyediakan titik masuk yang menguntungkan bagi investor tetapi juga membantu harta kekayaan FTX, yang dikelola di bawah pengawasan John J. Ray III, dalam melikuidasi asetnya dengan cara yang meminimalkan gangguan pasar.   Dengan menyetujui periode vesting hingga empat tahun, investor berkontribusi pada strategi distribusi bertahap, sehingga meredakan dampak pada harga pasar SOL.   Relevansi akuisisi ini melampaui implikasi finansial langsung bagi investor. Dengan harta kekayaan FTX memegang sekitar 41,1 juta SOL, yang setara dengan sekitar 10 persen dari total pasokannya, penjualan ini mewakili peristiwa signifikan dalam ekosistem kripto.   Strategi pembuangan ini, yang bertujuan untuk membuka dana untuk menyelesaikan klaim kreditur, menunjukkan keterkaitan antara bursa kripto, perusahaan investasi, dan dinamika pasar yang lebih luas.   Tujuan penggalangan dana yang ditetapkan oleh Pantera untuk menutup dana pada akhir Februari, meskipun tidak diungkapkan secara publik dalam hal jumlah yang terkumpul, menandakan minat komunitas investasi dalam peluang unik seperti ini.   Dengan ambang batas investasi minimum sebesar US$25 juta dan struktur biaya yang terdiri dari biaya manajemen 0,75 persen dan potongan kinerja 10 persen, Pantera Solana Fund melayani segmen investor tertentu yang mencari peluang dengan taruhan tinggi, imbal hasil tinggi dalam pasar kripto.   Di luar akuisisi langsung SOL, narasi ini juga menyentuh ekosistem yang lebih luas di sekitar Solana. FTX, bersama dengan firma saudaranya Alameda Research, secara historis telah berinvestasi dalam startup dalam ekosistem Solana, menyoroti sifat investasi yang saling terkait di seluruh lanskap kripto.   Inisiatif seperti dana permainan blockchain US$100 juta, yang diumumkan dalam kemitraan dengan Solana Ventures dan Lightspeed Venture Partners, menggarisbawahi pentingnya pengembangan ekosistem dan potensi efek riak dari kebangkrutan FTX di berbagai sektor dalam kripto.   TLintasan harga SOL, dengan kenaikan 650 persen pasca-krisis FTX dan harga perdagangan saat ini yang signifikan di atas titik rendahnya, menggambarkan sifat pasar kripto yang volatil namun tangguh.   Apresiasi substansial dalam nilai SOL, bersama dengan ramalan optimis oleh analis yang memprediksi melebihi rekor tertinggi sebelumnya, menempatkan Solana sebagai titik fokus dalam evolusi berkelanjutan teknologi blockchain dan adopsi kripto. 
Harga SOL Diprediksi Melesat ke US$1.000   Analis kripto, termasuk Altcoin Sherpa, memproyeksikan pandangan bullish untuk SOL, membayangkan akan melampaui rekor tertinggi sebelumnya sebesar US$259 dan berpotensi mencapai tonggak sejarah US$500 hingga US$1.000 di masa depan.   ""Masih salah satu prediksi saya yang lebih besar, US$170 jadi level naik [SOL] selanjutnya,"" ujarnya.      Prediksi ini tidak hanya menyoroti sifat spekulatif dari investasi kripto, tetapi juga menekankan keyakinan pada dasar teknologi Solana dan perannya dalam ekosistem aset digital yang lebih luas.    ",['SOL'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea8f8ac06a1631354e2cac/

Pantera Raising Fund to Buy up to $250M $SOL,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TokenInsight,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"Pantera is seeking funds for the Pantera Solana Fund, which has an “opportunity” to buy up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens from the FTX estate, according to marketing materials from February sent to prospective investors and seen by Bloomberg. In return for the option of buying SOL at 39% below a 30-day average price or at $59.95, investors must agree to a vesting period as long as four years.
Proposals like Pantera’s would allow FTX liquidators led by John J. Ray III to offload SOL and free up funds for creditors without putting immediate pressure on the token’s price. The estate holds 41.1 million SOL coins according to Pantera’s pitch document, worth $5.4 billion at Wednesday’s close and equivalent to roughly 10% of the total supply. The price of SOL jumped as much as 14% on Thursday.
SOL has soared almost 650% in the past 12 months as the crypto bull market gathered pace, creating an opportunity for the FTX estate to raise money for repaying creditors. The coin is trading at almost four times its price when FTX imploded in November 2022. FTX’s co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Sam Bankman-Fried, who is awaiting sentencing on multiple counts of fraud, was a major backer of the Solana network.
Pantera was aiming to close the fund by the end of February, according to the investor pitch. The Menlo Park, California-based firm raised some money by the deadline, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named discussing confidential information. The person declined to provide a dollar figure.
The trade-off for investors — who must put in at least $25 million each to participate — is that the SOL tokens will initially be locked and will vest gradually over four years. Pantera plans to charge a management fee of 0.75% along with a performance cut of 10%, the materials show.
Pantera isn’t the only outfit spotting an opportunity. Phoenix Digital LLC, founded by former Jefferies Financial Group Inc. credit trader Tian Zheng, has set up a similar vehicle and is seeking to buy SOL from the FTX exchange at $64 apiece, or a 51% discount to Wednesday’s close, according to marketing materials dated March 2 and seen by Bloomberg.
“Currently, [the FTX estate] is auctioning off Locked Solana OTC at a discount to spot price because of the large size and illiquidity of this block,” the Phoenix pitch deck said.
Investors in the vehicle, Phoenix Digital Series 2, are subject to a vesting period similar to Pantera’s. The locked-up tokens would be staked — a method of earning rewards for validating transactions on the Solana blockchain — to deliver an annual yield of around 7%.","['SOL', 'WHEN', 'PHB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea8bf65d272771c7fef5dd/
Ripple News: Unraveling the Truth Behind XRP Price Manipulation Allegations,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-08 07:00:00,"The post Ripple News: Unraveling the Truth Behind XRP Price Manipulation Allegations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Ripple manipulating XRP price through bots has been a common debatable topic in the crypto space. Ever since the SEC’s court filing accusing Ripple of manipulating its XRP price through bots, many supporters have spoken against it. 
Sherrie, a crypto enthusiast and an experienced debater, has delved into the discussion of whether Ripple through the “xrp 2t 6t bot” and the employment of GSR, has manipulated XRP prices. Ever since the court filing, Sherrie is the first to place her opinion on this matter. 
Let’s have a look at it – 
Understanding Manipulation vs. Causation
Sherrie’s main base of argument is causation and manipulation and initiates the claims by distinguishing between manipulation and causation. 

“What is manipulation? Simply put, it is the handling of a situation in a skillful way.
What is causation? Simply put, the action that follows an event or occurrence.”

Witfully referencing the analogy with a falling apple, she highlights that manipulation involves skilful handling, while causation refers to the natural outcome of an event. 
Skillfully, she then applies this to crypto, she sets the stage for a deeper exploration.
“Market manipulation is ILLEGAL, and Ripple isn’t doing it.”
Addressing the manipulation questions, Sherrie referred to a case where Ripple sells and later rebuys XRP. She clarifies that this activity does impact the price due to changes in supply and demand, but it doesn’t necessarily indicate control over the price. 
Focusing on economic concepts, she highlights that fundamental forces determine market prices.
Contrary to manipulation claims, Sherrie declared the ‘Facts’ – “Ripple is NOT manipulating the price of XRP.” 

She referred to the outcomes of audits and investigations, asserting, “After multiple audits and investigations into the business, it was determined by evidence and a federal judge that XRP follows Bitcoin.”

Sherrie dove into the legalities surrounding market manipulation, citing specific regulations. She emphasized, “On a federal level, the key manipulation regulations are in the 1933 Securities Act, 1934 Exchange Act, 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, and lastly… Title 18 of the U.S. code.”
In the end, the truth remains the same (as per Sherrie). 

“Market manipulation is ILLEGAL, and Ripple isn’t doing it.”

"What Will March Look Like For Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), And Retik Finance (RETIK)? This Analyst Sees More Green Candles.",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 08:00:00,"
The crypto market is enthusiastic as March promises to be a momentous month. With Bitcoin edging upwards, Ethereum waiting in the wings, and newcomer Retik Finance sparking intense hype, analysts forecast smooth sailing.
Bitcoin (BTC) Bulls Charge Ahead as BTC Consolidates Above $62,000
Bitcoin has kicked off March on a high note, showcasing a 1.5% increase to hover above the pivotal $62,000 level. This surge has pushed 99% of Bitcoin addresses into profitability, sparking intense debate on whether Bitcoin is on the cusp of an explosive bull run. Renowned analyst PlanB predicts 10 months of immense growth fueled by FOMO, citing Bitcoin's transition from accumulation to market adoption. This forecast aligns with historical trends observed after previous halving events. With spot Bitcoin ETF approvals amplifying investor interest, projections suggest Bitcoin could hit between $100,000 and $120,000 by Q4 2024.
Ethereum ETF Hopefuls Await SEC Decision, Potentially Igniting Next Crypto Surge
As Bitcoin marches upwards, the focus shifts to another heavy hitter - Ethereum. The SEC plans to decide on a spot Ethereum ETF in May, and the stakes are high. Ethereum provides the foundation for decentralized apps, smart contracts, NFTs and more, cementing its status as a crypto pillar. Demand for ETH is surging, with exchange reserves at all-time lows and over $20 billion worth of ETH locked in staking pools and DeFi protocols. Upgrades like the Dencun upgrade promise to augment Ethereum's capabilities further. Ethereum ETFs simplify exposure for investors, potentially attracting massive inflows. Major financial players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are eagerly awaiting SEC approval.

Analyst Predicts ETH Surge to 6-7K in 60 Days After Accurate Calls,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Crypto News Land,2024-03-08 08:00:00,"
Analyst accurately predicted $ETH’s rise to $4000, following buy calls at $1000 and $2000 regions.
Despite previous accurate forecasts, many investors showed FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) at higher prices.
New prediction suggests $ETH could reach 6-7K within the next 60 days, urging investors to consider the potential.

In the world of cryptocurrency, accurate predictions are like gold dust. One analyst has proven their mettle by accurately forecasting Ethereum’s (ETH) price movements, not just once but multiple times. Initially, when $ETH was hovering around the $1000 and $2000 marks, this expert shared buy calls, signaling a bullish outlook. However, many seemed to overlook these recommendations, possibly doubting the cryptocurrency’s potential for further growth.



Seems many people ignored my buy calls for $ETH at $1000 and $2000 region and are FOMO buying hard nowI even warned you two weeks ago at $3000 that $4000 is coming in next few days, and was right again.Now I tell you 6-7k coming in 60 days— Doctor Profit  (@DrProfitCrypto) March 7, 2024




Fast forward to two weeks ago, the same analyst warned that Ethereum was on its way to hit the $4000 mark in the coming days—a prediction that materialized much to the regret of those who ignored the earlier advice. This series of accurate forecasts showcases not only the volatility and growth potential within the crypto market but also highlights the analyst’s understanding and analysis capabilities.
Now, the prediction horizon has been extended further, with the analyst suggesting a staggering rise to 6-7K for $ETH within the next 60 days. This bold forecast comes at a time when the crypto market is witnessing significant interest and investment, driving up the prices and market cap of major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.
Investors who previously missed out on capitalizing on this expert’s forecasts may now be considering a more serious look at their advice. While the crypto market is inherently unpredictable and influenced by a myriad of factors, having a track record of accurate predictions can certainly make forecasts more compelling. As Ethereum continues to grow, both in value and in its applications across decentralized finance (DeFi) and other sectors, the potential for significant price movements cannot be ignored.
Investors and enthusiasts are now watching closely, wondering if this new prediction will come to fruition, or if the market will take a different turn. Regardless, the importance of thorough research, market analysis, and sometimes a bit of intuition, is underscored in the volatile world of cryptocurrency investing.

Expert Predicts 1000% Surge For Solana Rival Retik Finance (RETIK) In The Coming Months; Says Ethereum (ETH) And Dogecoin (DOGE) Momentum Wi...,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Crypto News Land,2024-03-08 08:00:00,"The cryptocurrency market is excited as a leading expert predicts a massive 1000% price surge for Solana rival Retik Finance (RETIK) as the 2024 bull rally heats up. The expert also sees a wild run for crypto top 10’s Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE).
Retik Finance Presale Sells Out Months Ahead of Schedule
In a major milestone, decentralized finance (DeFi) startup Retik Finance recently concluded its presale, having raised an impressive $32.05 million in funding. The presale concluded months ahead of schedule, evidencing a strong investor appetite for the project. The crypto expert expressed delight at the presale success, attributing it to the unwavering support of the Retik Finance community. He also noted the ongoing plans to share key details regarding the token listing and vesting schedule in the days ahead as another bullish catalyst.Retik Finance has also announced a $5000 giveaway open to 25 lucky winners to celebrate crossing this significant milestone.
Powerful Solana Competitor
Retik Finance positions itself as a formidable challenger to leading chains such as Solana by offering a suite of DeFi solutions that include DeFi debit cards, a non-custodial wallet, a payment gateway, a P2P lending protocol, and perpetual futures and options trading. Built on Ethereum, Retik Finance adheres to the ERC-20 token standard. Retik Finance native token, RETIK, carries a maximum supply of 1 billion and serves as the lifeblood of its burgeoning ecosystem. Retik Finance has already been listed on top data aggregators like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap even ahead of public exchange listing. The project has also completed a Certik security audit, attesting to its security and technical robustness.
Expert Predicts 1000% RETIK Price Surge
Sharing his bullish outlook on Retik Finance, the crypto analyst remarked, “Retik Finance checks all the right boxes – a solid tokenomics structure, complete audits, a loaded roadmap, and most importantly, real-world utility spanning DeFi debit cards to P2P lending.” Given its vast potential, he anticipates massive FOMO from investors when RETIK lists publicly. The expert predicts, “We could easily see a 1000% price explosion from Retik Finance within months as it aggressively expands its ecosystem.”
Dogecoin and Ethereum Momentum to Persist
The expert also shared positive outlooks for leading crypto assets Ethereum and Dogecoin. On Ethereum, the expert commented, “The growth of the Ethereum ecosystem continues unabated. With the upcoming Dencun upgrade, ETH 2.0 will take Ethereum’s price to new highs.” Likewise, speaking on meme-currency Dogecoin, he added, “Dogecoin continues to ride the wave of meme-coin mania among retail investors. Technically, too, Dogecoin is looking strong to retest its previous all-time-high.” He cited the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as a critical driver likely to sustain the momentum for Dogecoin and Ethereum in the months ahead. The crypto expert remains optimistic that Dogecoin and Ethereum still have ample room for growth. The confluence of surging interest in meme coins like Dogecoin coupled with the expanding utility of Ethereum makes for a powerful combination. As both Dogecoin and Ethereum push towards reclaiming their all-time highs, the next few months promise to be an exciting period for HODLers of these crypto assets. With tailwinds including protocol upgrades and Bitcoin’s halving providing impetus, the expert suggests the bullish momentum for both Dogecoin and Ethereum will continue unimpeded over the coming months.
Conclusion
The overwhelming success of the recently concluded Retik Finance presale, coupled with optimistic projections of 1000% growth, has excited market participants. The Retik token RETIK remains firmly in investor crosshairs as the project gears up for public launch. Meanwhile, bullish sentiments surrounding Ethereum and Dogecoin point to a sustained upside for these crypto assets.

The firm’s intent in this regard became clear in August of last year when Bitstamp sought capital funding to enable it to extend the platform’s reach into various markets across Asia.Whilst the company’s origins can  be traced back to Slovenia, it has since developed further ties with Asia. In 2018, the company was acquired by NXMH, a subsidiary of South Korea’s NXC Corporation. The same holding company owns Korean crypto exchange Korbit.Compliance strategyWhile the licensing is quite the achievement, the company already boasts a robust regulatory track record, surpassing the 50-license mark across key markets such as Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France the United States (with coverage in 40 states including New York, Washington, Texas and Florida) and the United Kingdom.In its press release the company referred to its ever-growing licensing collection, outlining that “compliance and regulation [are] at the heart of all operations.”Leonard Hoh, Bitstamp's APAC General Manager, lauded Singapore's proactive stance in establishing a regulatory framework for crypto exchanges, positioning the city-state as a pivotal player in the digital assets landscape. Singapore has already granted full licenses to several crypto service providers, including Blockchain.com, Circle, Coinbase and Ripple.In late 2023, Bitstamp initiated talks with three major European banks regarding the potential introduction of cryptocurrency services in 2024. This signals a broader trend within the EU, where the crypto regulatory initiative, MiCA, is smoothing the path for traditional financial institutions to venture into the digital assets realm.Robert Zagotta, Bitstamp’s Chief Commercial Officer, highlighted the surge in interest surrounding its “Bitstamp-as-a-Service” offering, especially within European circles. This service furnishes a white-label licensing framework, coupled with requisite technology, to aid banks and fintech entities in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions for their clientele.However, the regulatory landscape isn't as welcoming in India, where the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block the URLs of nine major global crypto exchanges, including Bitstamp, in late 2023.",['BTC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea7129b8024d06250b18dc/
Fed’s Powell allays digital dollar anxiety as nations ramp up CBDC efforts,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 09:00:00,"The United States is “nowhere near” any form of central bank digital currency (CBDC), and even if it was, the central bank has no interest in one that surveils users, said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
“I want to say that we’re nowhere near recommending or let alone adopting a central bank digital currency in any form,” Powell said in a March 7 hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.
It comes the same day as Hong Kong’s central bank launched a new push for a wholesale CBDC and days after geopolitical bloc BRICS reportedly started work on a blockchain-based payments system.
A Philippines central bank official also said on March 6 that the country’s wholesale CBDC would be completed by the end of the year.
Powell also addressed concerns that a retail-focused CBDC could allow for surveillance and “that the government would see all your transactions” — highlighting China’s digital yuan as an example.

 “That’s just something we would not stand for, or do, or propose here in the United States.”

If the Fed were to ever launch a CBDC — which it’s “a very long way from even thinking about” — it would be done “through the banking system,” Powell added. 
“The last thing we would want — we, the Federal Reserve, would want — would be to have individual accounts for all Americans, or any Americans for that matter,” he said.
“Only banks have accounts at the Fed, and that’s the way we’re going to keep it,” Powell asserted. “People don’t need to worry about a central bank digital currency, nothing like that is remotely close to happening anytime soon.”

Powell has long said it’s up to Congress to give the Fed permission to make a retail CBDC, and he again affirmed that position during the hearing.

Senator Cynthia Lummis claimed there were concerns “about the Fed creating a CBDC without legislative authorization.”
“Do you still agree that the Federal Reserve cannot introduce a U.S. central bank digital currency without congressional authorization?” Lummis asked Powell.
“Yes, I do,” Powell responded.
December 2023 data from Washington D.C. think tank the Atlantic Council shows 11 countries — mainly in the Caribbean — have launched a CBDC. Pilot CBDC trials are active in 21 countries, including China’s e-yuan, and 33 are still developing their CBDC implementations.
President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March 2022 that urged the Fed to explore a possible CBDC.

SafePal invests in & partners with Switzerland’s Fiat24,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinNess Global,2024-03-08 09:00:00,"Singaporean crypto wallet provider SafePal has announced a strategic investment in Swiss bank Fiat24, together with the launch of a number of financial services. The partnership is a significant milestone in bridging the gap between the crypto world and real-world financial utilities.Visa card and in-app bankingThe company outlined in a blog post on March 7 that the centerpiece of this collaboration is the introduction of a crypto-focused Visa card and in-app banking services, both designed to streamline the integration of digital assets into everyday transactions. The default deposit currency for these services is the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), providing users with a stable foundation for their financial activities.Through the SafePal mobile wallet app, users can convert their cryptocurrency holdings into USDC via Ethereum layer two scaling network Arbitrum, making for an efficient and reliable process. Once converted, the USDC can be stored in multiple fiat currencies, including USD, EUR and CHF, enabling seamless utilization in various transactions and expenses.Enabling Swiss bank account accessOne of the standout aspects of this initiative is the opportunity for users to establish individually owned, fully compliant bank accounts directly within the SafePal mobile wallet app. By completing the necessary know-your-customer (KYC) and onboarding procedures through Fiat24.Opening such bank accounts will be free, with no account creation or annual management fees being applied. However, transfer and deposit fees will be applied starting from a base rate of 0.6%. The project believes that the integration of NFT technology on Arbitrum will ensure the security and transparency of all related transactions.Veronica Wong, CEO and co-founder of SafePal, emphasized the importance of addressing the accessibility challenges faced by crypto users in a communication with CoinDesk. She highlighted the significance of providing a crypto-friendly banking experience that eliminates the hurdles imposed by traditional financial institutions.Additional payment platform partnershipsIn addition to the crypto Visa cards, SafePal has forged partnerships with leading payment platforms such as Paypal, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, expanding the usability and convenience of its services.While the Visa card will initially be available in select European regions, plans are underway for its gradual expansion across the continent. Similarly, the in-app banking gateway will cater to users outside the United States and in non-U.S. sanctioned countries, fostering greater accessibility on a global scale.Working towards market growth through a partnership strategy is a route that SafePal has taken in the past. In May 2023 the company attempted to make further inroads into the Korean market by partnering with South Korean enterprise blockchain project Klaytn. In that instance, the wallet provider added support for digital assets that run on the Klaytn network via its mobile app, hardware wallet and browser extension-based wallet.In light of these developments, SafePal's SFP tokens have experienced a modest increase in value. At the time of writing, the token unit price stood at $0.8026, representing a 4.62% increase over the course of the past 24 hours.","['USDC', 'ARB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea6ce1c06a1631354e2c8b/

"Solana-Based Altcoin That’s Up 900%+ in a Month Primed for Monster Move, Says Top Trader – Here Are His Targets",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 09:00:00,"
A widely followed crypto analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on an altcoin in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem that has skyrocketed by triple digits in four weeks.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 244,400 followers on the social media platform X that the memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) is primed for a “monster” surge after making a V-shaped recovery on the hourly chart.
  

Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart, it appears that the memecoin has completed a three-wave pattern, which signifies the end of a correction, as per the Elliott Wave theory.
The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a minor corrective trend moves in a three-wave pattern.


   Source: Bluntz/X
  

WIF is trading at $2.08 at time of writing, a gain of 994% from the February 7th close of $0.190.
According to Bluntz, WIF could appreciate by up to 44% from the current level in the next leg of the rally.
“$2.50 – $3 next but you wouldn’t believe it.”

Bluntz also offers his forecast on the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin which has also recorded triple-digit rallies over the past 30 days.
“No impulsive decline yet on PEPE, still looks corrective and still expect fresh highs from here.”

PEPE is trading at $0.000008116 at time of writing, up around 780% over the past month. A 1000PEPE perpetual contract tracks the Pepe token and represents, as the symbol suggests, 1,000 PEPE tokens.

Gemini mulled forming a ‘juggernaut’ with Genesis before it went to smoke,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 09:00:00,"Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss once considered a merger with Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its cryptocurrency lending firm Genesis Global Capital (GGC) that could’ve birthed a publicly-listed “juggernaut” to compete with the likes of Coinbase and FTX.
That was, at least, a claim by DCG’s CEO Barry Silbert in a newly surfaced email to colleagues from October 2022 after a luncheon with Winklevoss — three months before Genesis eventually went bankrupt. 
The email was shared by lawyers representing DCG and Barry Silbert as part of a March 6 motion to dismiss a $3 billion fraud lawsuit filed by the Attorney General of the State of New York. The email was used to argue against allegations that Silbert knew Genesis was insolvent and believed it should be hidden from counterparties.
The email was used to argue against allegations that Silbert knew Genesis was insolvent and believed it should be hidden from counterparties, with lawyers arguing that Silbert's actions show the opposite.
“He is intrigued about the idea of a closer partnership between Genesis/Gemini/DCG, including a potential merger of the companies,” wrote Silbert.
Silbert said the merger would be “super exciting to investors,” and a potential $1 billion raise could lead to a public listing within 24 months. 
“Combined Gemini and Genesis would be a juggernaut,” Silbert reportedly pitched to Winklevoss, adding that it would be “competitive with Coinbase and FTX” and that Gemini could become the largest cryptocurrency custody provider in the world.

At the time of the lunch, the two firms had been closely intertwined in a cross-platform lending partnership for 18 months. GGC, however, was facing “hundreds of millions in losses” from overexposure to the now-collapsed Three Arrows Capital. 
Silbert also wrote he was honest with Winklevoss about GGC’s financial woes, which were received rather well:

 “I put him on clear notice [...] He took that part surprisingly well and appreciates we need to work together to mitigate that risk.”

He also stressed to colleagues that Genesis had to do whatever possible to “avoid a bank run,” or else it would be “difficult, if not impossible,” for the firm to find replacement liquidity

 “I cant raise money at DCG if there is a Genesis bankruptcy risk. So the ball is in their court to prevent a bad thing from happening.”

Silbert told his colleagues that Winklevoss would go back to his twin brother Tyler Winklevoss and come back with thoughts on “how to best proceed.”
Ultimately, the merger never went through. 
Related: Gemini to return at least $1.1B to Earn customers in settlement with NYDFS
Gemini launched its “Earn” program in February 2021 where customers would loan their coins to GGC in exchange for interest payments. 
However, that endeavor crossed a point of no return one month after the email when GGC halted withdrawals — including those from Gemini’s Earn program — citing “unprecedented market turmoil” stemming from FTX’s shock collapse.
GGC then fell bankrupt in January 2023, owing $1.2 billion to Gemini’s 232,000 Earn customers.
Since then, Winklevoss has threatened to sue Silbert on several occasions and has called him out for engaging in “fraudulent behavior” via a “culture of lies and deceit.”

Nissan has unveiled its latest venture into the digital world, launching a metaverse platform called “Heritage Cars & Safe Drive Studio” on March 7. This virtual space is dedicated to showcasing Nissan’s iconic car models and promoting driving safety through interactive and educational features.
Anniversary Tribute with Classic Models on Display
The initiative marks Nissan’s 90th anniversary and is highlighted by three legendary models from the company’s history, each presented in digitally recreated environments authentic to their time. The Silvia Q’s S13, renowned for its drifting capabilities, stands out as the first exhibit. Virtual visitors can explore the car in detail and learn about safety through elements like the influence of pedestrian apparel on driver visibility.
Following the Silvia, the platform features a mini-game that educates users on the dangers of multitasking while driving and provides insight into how it can affect a driver’s field of vision. The second exhibit also includes a glimpse into the iconic Skyline 2000GTX-E, celebrated in various media such as the Gran Turismo video game franchise and The Fast and the Furious films.
Interactive Experience with Vintage American Vibes
In the final section, users are transported to a 1950s to 60s American setting, complete with a classic diner and a drive-in theater ambiance. Here, they can engage in practical steering wheel maneuvering exercises. This immersive experience is the result of collaborative efforts with Japanese university researchers and builds upon Nissan’s previous ventures like the virtual test drives offered on the Meta Quest headset.
Nissan’s move into the metaverse aligns with the rising trend of virtual and augmented reality applications spearheaded by tech giants such as Meta and Microsoft. With the anticipated competition from Apple’s new mixed reality headset, the automotive industry is poised for a significant transformation.
The Heritage Cars & Safe Drive Studio is not just a nod to Nissan’s rich history but also serves as an educational platform for safe driving practices, reflecting Nissan’s commitment to innovation and responsible motoring.

Celebrating the Company’s 90th Anniversary as a Main Goal
According to Nissan’s press release, this studio has been assembled to celebrate the company’s 90th anniversary and is filled with three iconic models, each with detailed virtual environments reflecting their respective eras. First, the Silvia Q’s S13 model, famous for drifting, is showcased.

Here, users can examine the vehicle and access safety-focused information, such as the impact of pedestrian clothing colors on drivers.
The second exhibit hosts a mini-game focused on helping drivers understand their field of vision and the impact of multitasking on driving safety. Additionally, the Skyline 2000GTX-E model, known for its significant place in popular culture through the Gran Turismo video game series and The Fast and the Furious movie series, can also be examined here.
Opportunity for Practical Steering Wheel Turning Exercise
The final exhibit takes users back to the 1950s and 60s in the United States. This exhibit offers an environment reminiscent of “a classic American diner and drive-in movie theater” and provides users with the opportunity to practice steering wheel turning exercises.
These experiences have been developed in collaboration with researchers at universities in Japan. They also contribute to the company’s previous initiatives, such as Nissan’s prior virtual test drive offered on the Meta Quest headset.
With this move, Nissan is also aligning with current trends in the technology world. The rise of virtual and augmented reality applications, led by companies like Meta and Microsoft, is presenting new opportunities in the automotive industry. With the launch of Apple’s mixed reality headset, it’s clear that competition in this field will intensify.
Nissan’s metaverse exhibits not only showcase the company’s innovative spirit and respect for its history but also contribute to raising awareness about safe driving among drivers. It is possible to say that such innovative steps are promising for the future of the automotive industry.

Cryptocurrency market participants are showing a keen interest in the meme coin Shiba Inu, which has recently witnessed a notable price increase. The upward trend of the coin has sparked a wave of investor and expert attention, suggesting a potential surge in its value in the near term.
Analyst Foresees Impending Price Leap for Shiba Inu
Rekt Capital, a prominent crypto analyst and investor, has indicated a probable significant short-term price jump for Shiba Inu. The analysis disseminated through a social media platform details an upcoming scenario where the coin could surge to unprecedented highs by breaking through a vital resistance level.
Achieving this positive forecast, however, rests upon Shiba Inu’s ability to sustain certain price points. The asset’s upward trajectory hinges on a pivotal support level, colloquially termed the “blue level,” which must hold for the anticipated growth to continue.
Projections suggest that the Shiba Inu coin could hit the $0.000066 price mark shortly. While the coin has faced resistance at a particular level, it is forming a new base, which may serve as a springboard for a climb to higher valuations if it establishes itself as a firm support zone.
Rekt Capital’s Predictions Gain Traction
The accuracy of Rekt Capital’s predictions seems to be materializing, as SHIB has shown over a 300% increase since last November. This growth aligns with the analyst’s perspective that reclaiming the upper end of the “Orange area” as support has been integral to the coin’s ascent.
Moreover, analysis from Santiment identifies Shiba Inu as a cryptocurrency poised for a rebound, especially in a market where Bitcoin is hitting new peaks. As of now, SHIB is valued at $0.00003155, with a recent 13% downturn and a corresponding decline in market capitalization and trade volume. Despite short-term fluctuations, the coin’s long-term potential remains the focus of speculation.

"Solana Surges Over 14%, Eyes $150 Resistance as Bullish Momentum Builds",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Crypto News Land,2024-03-08 03:57:19.561058,"
Solana’s value surpasses $145, marking a remarkable 14% surge in just 24 hours.
Solana’s market cap rises to $65 billion, reflecting a 1,800% increase from its lowest point in 2023.
DEX trading volume for Solana hits record highs, exceeding $2 billion and peaking at $2.85 billion in a single day.

Within just 24 hours, Solana’s (SOL) price soared past the $145 mark, showcasing a substantial increase of over 14%. This surge highlights the growing investor interest and confidence in Solana’s potential.
One of the most striking aspects of Solana’s recent performance is its meteoric rise in market capitalization. Currently valued at $65 billion, Solana has witnessed an astonishing growth of over 1,800% from its lowest point in 2023. This significant increase underscores the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana and its promising future prospects.
Another noteworthy development is the surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for Solana. Data from reliable sources indicate that DEX trading volume for Solana has consistently surpassed $2 billion, reaching a record high of $2.85 billion in a single day. This surge in trading activity not only demonstrates the growing popularity of Solana but also reflects the vibrant ecosystem surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
The broader cryptocurrency market has also experienced positive momentum, with Bitcoin maintaining its position above the $67,000 threshold. This overall market buoyancy has had a positive impact on Solana and other altcoins, contributing to Solana’s robust performance.
As Solana continues to exhibit strong upward momentum, analysts are closely monitoring key technical indicators. The MACD indicator suggests bullish tendencies, while the RSI hovers above the 70 mark, indicating a potential overbought scenario. Additionally, the placement of the 20-EMA over the 50-EMA hints at the potential upward movement for Solana, reinforcing the positive market sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are optimistic about the near-term rise of Shiba Inu. Recently, Shiba Inu has become a popular meme coin in the crypto market, gaining significant momentum and drawing attention. Particularly in the last few weeks, the price increase of this digital asset has caught the interest of investors and experts alike.
Expectations of a Price Surge for Shiba Inu
Cryptocurrency analyst and investor Rekt Capital predicts a short-term significant price increase for Shiba Inu. Rekt Capital’s analysis shared with the crypto community on social media platform X suggests that Shiba Inu could rise to levels not seen for a long time. The analyst indicates that the digital asset could make substantial progress by overcoming a resistance point.
However, for these optimistic predictions to materialize, Shiba Inu will need to maintain certain levels. The support point marked as the “blue level” will be critical for the asset to continue its upward trend.

According to this analysis, Shiba Inu is expected to reach a price level of $0.000066 in the near future. On the other hand, the analyst emphasizes that Shiba Inu has rejected a certain price resistance and is currently forming a new accumulation range for a potential upward trend. However, this level must function as new support for SHIB to climb to higher levels.
Predictions Appear to be Confirmed
According to Rekt Capital’s forecasts, the predictions about Shiba Inu reaching the blue resistance point seem to be confirmed. It is noted that since last November, SHIB has increased by over 300%. The analyst states that this increase is related to reclaiming the top of the Orange area as support.
According to Santiment’s analysis, Shiba Inu is identified as one of the leading assets ready for a potential recovery. This is particularly true during a period when Bitcoin reaches new highs and assets like Solana experience speculative surges, with other cryptocurrencies also expected to recover.
As of writing this article, SHIB is trading at $0.00003155. SHIB has experienced a 13% decrease in recent days, with its market value and trading volume decreasing accordingly.

Ethereum’s Optimism Network Advances to OP Sepolia Testnet,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-08 01:57:33.494264,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Ethereum’s Optimism Network Advances to OP Sepolia Testnet
The Ethereum Layer-2 network, Optimism, has recently accomplished a significant milestone by migrating from the OP Goerli testnet to the OP Sepolia testnet. This move aligns with the Ethereum community’s broader strategy to phase out the Goerli test network by the end of 2023. The Optimism team is now spearheading the transition and encouraging developers and applications to utilize OP Sepolia for future testing and development endeavors.
Transition to OP Sepolia: A Call to Developers
OP Sepolia, with its forward-looking approach, is gaining traction in the blockchain environment. As the Ethereum community prepares to fully retire the Goerli testnet by January 2024, developers are urged to shift their focus to OP Sepolia. This testnet offers a more reliable and in-sync platform with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), ensuring a safer and more effective testing ground for Web3 projects and applications.
Developers and end-users are advised to make the move to OP Sepolia before the January 2024 deadline to guarantee the seamless functioning of their applications. The process facilitates the transition for users who wish to experiment within a testnet setting, with the Superchain faucet providing up to 1 test ETH per day to support this environment on Sepolia testnets.
The popular Web3 wallet, Metamask, has already integrated support for the OP Sepolia testnet, making access and network information readily available for its users.
Significance of Testnets in Blockchain Innovation
In the fast-paced world of blockchain development, the use of testnets is crucial to mitigate potential losses caused by application flaws. Testnets serve as critical platforms where Layer-2 network projects can be rigorously tested prior to their official release. They offer a controlled space for developers to refine their applications or for users to participate in testing phases through events like airdrops. The shift from Goerli to Sepolia exemplifies the ongoing efforts to maintain a robust and efficient testing infrastructure within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has given the nod for the regulated development of tokenized assets in Hong Kong. 
According to the March 7 announcement, the city’s new initiative, Project Ensemble, will seek to develop a new wholesale Hong Kong dollar central bank digital currency (wCBDC) and explore the citys innovative financial market infrastructure.

Singapores Bitdeer’s memorable quarter
Singaporean cryptocurrency miner Bitdeers revenue surged by 49% year over year in the last quarter of 2023 to $114.8 million. As per earning results reported on March 4, the firm’s losses also narrowed from $13.04 million in Q4 2022 to $5.03 million during the same period. 
In January, Cointelegraph reported that Jihan Wu, former CEO of Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Bitmain, will retake the reins as CEO after having founded the firm in 2020. Wu is also the founder of crypto financial services firm Matrixport. 
Matrixport made waves in January after a report from its analysts speculated that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would not approve listings of spot Bitcoin BTC exchange-traded funds due to political risk. The SEC subsequently approved such offerings on Jan. 10.
Despite an ongoing bull market, Bitcoin miners have been experiencing a troubled recovery as rising electricity prices, mining difficulty, and a 50% reduction in block rewards as part of Bitcoins anticipated halving in April have all taken a toll on bottom lines. One such Bitcoin miner, Singapore-based Sai.Tech, has seen its stock lose over 95% of its value since its initial listing on the Nasdaq exchange in April 2022.

Blockchain ecosystems continue to witness notable developments. Accordingly, the Ethereum Layer-2 network Optimism has successfully completed its transition from the OP Goerli testnet to the OP Sepolia testnet. The Goerli test network has been phased out by the Ethereum community since January 2023 and its use was only continued until the end of 2023.
Optimism Team Takes Noteworthy Step
OP Sepolia is showing progress towards a sustainable future, and the Optimism team is encouraging all applications and developers to move to OP Sepolia for all testing and development needs. Ethereum Goerli and its counterpart OP Goerli will be completely phased out by January 2024. When a testnet is phased out (as was the case with past Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan testnets), it loses parity with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it unsafe and ineffective for testing applications and other Web3 projects.
To ensure your testnet application works as intended on the OP Sepolia testnet, all developers and end-users are encouraged by the team to make the transition before January 2024. Following this process, end-users wanting to trial in a testnet environment will begin to do so on the OP Sepolia testnet instead of OP Goerli. Testnet funds can be requested up to 1 test ETH per day through the Superchain faucet, which also supports Sepolia testnets.
The Web3 wallet Metamask already supports the OP Sepolia testnet network, so users can find network information through Metamask.

Blockchain Space and Testnet Processes
Blockchain developments, while exciting for users, can lead to significant losses due to issues in applications, particularly those in Layer-2 network projects. Therefore, testing an application on testnet networks before its market release is of great importance in the Web3 ecosystem.
During this process, application teams can address their own developments or involve users in the testing process through airdrop events. In the Ethereum ecosystem, this environment can be addressed through testnet ecosystems like Goerli or Sepolia.

Despite the volatility of Bitcoin‘s (BTC) price, including a recent 15% drop to $59,500, investor interest in the cryptocurrency remains high. Contributing to this interest is the significant $1 billion in Bitcoin ETF volume, which has brought the total to $8.11 billion since its market inception. Although the market saw a second notable dip since the ETF introduction, the overall market entry of ETFs seems to have lessened the impact of these declines.
Market Response to Bitcoin ETFs
The trading volume of Bitcoin ETFs signifies an escalating acceptance of the cryptocurrency as an investment product. Despite this week’s price correction, which signifies the second major downturn subsequent to the ETFs’ debut, the market is adapting. Investors appear to be strategically taking profits following substantial increases since early January.
The least popular five ETFs, worth a combined $660 million, have a negligible market influence, as evidenced by GBTC trading at a discount of up to 50%. This suggests that GBTC holders are relatively unfazed by the market’s fluctuations. Additionally, even with $10 billion exiting Bitcoin, the influx of ETFs into the market has made these outflows appear less concerning.
Analysis of Bitcoin’s Price Movements
The market is undergoing considerable shifts, particularly with the forthcoming Bitcoin supply halving expected in about 42 days. Currently, Bitcoin trades at $67,400, with a modest 24-hour increase. Predictions suggest that a price dip to $63,200 could result in $2.2 billion in long position liquidations, whereas a rise to $70,000 could liquidate $2.4 billion in short positions.
Such price fluctuations can intensify selling pressure by liquidating long positions, potentially leading to a rapid decline as traders exit their stakes. Conversely, an upward trend could trigger a short squeeze, with traders rushing to cover their positions, adding to the buying pressure and potentially propelling prices higher.

Bitcoin‘s (BTC) price experienced significant fluctuations recently, yet the general interest in BTC continues to be notably strong. The increase in BTC liquidity further highlights the growing interest in BTC.
Current State of ETFs
Recent data shows that approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF volume has emerged, reaching an important level of $8.11 billion since the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs to the market.
This week, the price of Bitcoin saw a 15% pullback to $59,500, considered the bottom level from its new all-time high (ATH), raising questions as this was the second significant drop since ETFs were launched.
The previous drop on the day ETFs started trading was around 20%. The latest drop seemed to be the result of strategic moves by investors looking to secure their profits, especially after the substantial gains since January 11.
Five ETFs with the lowest entry, totaling $660 million in value, were relatively insignificant in terms of market tracking. In particular, GBTC trading at a 50% discount at one point suggests that investors holding GBTC may have continued without much concern over the 20% drop.
Despite a $10 billion outflow from BTC, the successful market entry of ETFs seemed to make the current declines less significant.
Looking at past cycles, expectations pointed to a drop of over 30%, while the last ATH before the halving indicated that the traditional structure might have changed. The changing structure, especially with no outflows in the last two days, clearly reflected the changing buyer profiles in the market due to increased entries.

Bitcoin Price Outlook
Moreover, significant changes are being observed in the market as Bitcoin’s supply is expected to halve in about 42 days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,400, indicating a 2.09% increase in the last 24 hours.
If the price were to drop to $63,200, it is estimated that $2.2 billion worth of long positions could be liquidated, while a potential rise to $70,000 could liquidate approximately $2.4 billion worth of short positions.
Price movements that trigger the liquidation of long positions could increase selling pressure, leading to traders weakening and abandoning their positions, potentially accelerating the downward momentum.
Conversely, short liquidations caused by a price move to $70,000 could create a squeeze, leading traders to compete to close their positions.

AVAX surges 10% to $43.78 despite market volatility, showcasing its resilience and investor confidence.
Growing network activity with increased new and active addresses underscores Avalanche’s strengthening fundamental sentiment.
Many AVAX holders are in profit, indicating strong support levels and potential for further price appreciation.

Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a notable 10% increase, reaching a price of $43.78. This surge comes amidst a period of market volatility triggered by Bitcoin’s sudden drop below $60,000, followed by a swift recovery above $67,000.
Despite the overall decrease in trading volume by 25%, Avalanche has demonstrated resilience, with its market capitalization growing by 9% to reach $16 billion. This remarkable performance has propelled Avalanche to become the 11th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. There is speculation that Avalanche could potentially enter the top ten cryptocurrencies, potentially displacing others like Shiba Inu Coin with its current market cap of $16.5 billion.
Avalanche’s recent price movements have been supported by positive developments within its ecosystem. The number of new addresses created on the Avalanche protocol has seen a noticeable uptick, indicating sustained interest in the platform within the decentralized economy. Additionally, network activity has been on the rise, with an increasing number of active addresses transacting on the blockchain.
The surge in Avalanche’s price reflects its improving fundamental sentiment, especially considering its recovery from a low of $27 in January to its current value. The recent dip in prices prompted some investors to capitalize on the opportunity to accumulate more AVAX.
With a significant portion of AVAX holders currently in profit, there is a strong support zone forming between certain price levels, indicating a reluctance to sell among these investors. This could potentially lead to further buying pressure and an upward trajectory for Avalanche in the medium term.

The cryptocurrency landscape is buzzing as Pepe Coin captures investor interest, with its recent price performance raising questions about its growth potential. As a meme coin, Pepe Coin’s value surged by 650%, sparking discussions about its sustainability and future trajectory. Despite the volatility typical of such assets, the coin’s consolidation suggests a possible bullish trend. While the MACD indicator remains unresponsive post-decline, there’s anticipation of further value increases.
Assessing Pepe Coin’s Future Value
Market analysts speculate a 60% surge in Pepe Coin’s value, targeting a price point of $0.0000104. This projection aligns with the current enthusiasm for meme coins and contemplates surpassing previous resistance barriers to establish new records. With an optimistic forecast set for January 2026, the coin’s future prices remain subject to the whims of market volatility.
Impact on the Meme Coin Ecosystem
Pepe Coin’s ascent is casting a shadow over fellow meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, signaling its robust market position and investor allure. Climbing the ranks to join the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, Pepe Coin may be at the cusp of a more significant upswing. Additionally, the broader crypto market’s current state, marked by Bitcoin‘s stabilization, has amplified the presence of alternative coins, offering opportunities for growth among less prominent digital assets.
Amidst this heightened interest, the inherent risk associated with meme coins remains, with their primary appeal lying in their potential for price appreciation. As of the latest update, Pepe Coin’s trading value sits at $0.00000676, illustrating the dynamic and speculative nature of this market segment.

Solana’s Network Price Surge: Is Another Leg Up Imminent? SOL Experts Eye Further Gains,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 00:57:52.779315,"Solana’s network popularity has significantly increased over the past week with daily transaction volumes surpassing new records. According to data, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on the Solana network exceeded $2 billion for four consecutive days from March 3 to March 6. Notably, trading activity reached an all-time high of $2.85 billion on March 5, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X.
The heavy activity on the Solana blockchain has resulted in some network congestion issues over the past few days. However, many traders and analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s long-term prospects. Bluntz , a cryptocurrency analyst, stated in two separate tweets that he believes Solana is gearing up for its “next leg up” and subsequent “revenge pump” in price.
Bluntz pointed out that Solana’s USD trading pair has formed an accumulation pattern and its Bitcoin trading pair has developed an “abc zig zag” pattern, implying an upwards breakout is imminent. He argued that most traders seem to have given up on Solana after its recent consolidation phase but the coming price surge could catch many by surprise.

Technical Breakout Confirmed
In another positive development for Solana investors and supporters, analyst Rekt Capital tweeted that Solana has now confirmed a breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on its price chart against the US Dollar. As per CoinMarketCap data, Solana’s price rose over 14% in the past 24 hours to reach $149.02, providing credence to the analysts anticipating the next bullish move.



Long-term Solana proponent Ansem opined that backing from Pantera Capital, one of the earliest and largest cryptocurrency funds, signifies how bullish the long-term Solana outlook is. He pointed out that Pantera was buying Bitcoin when it was valued under $100 back in 2013, highlighting their status as “OGs of OGs” in the crypto space. Ansem has remained a staunch Solana supporter since its price was seven times lower than the current levels.
Promising Fundamentals Fuel Optimism
While network congestion remains a near-term concern, analysts and investors expect Solana to make its next big move higher in line with its promising fundamentals and ecosystem growth. The combination of increasing on-chain activity, supportive technical patterns, and endorsements from seasoned investors paint an optimistic picture for Solana’s medium to long-term prospects.

Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing a highly active period, filled with exciting developments for investors. The rise of meme coins such as Pepe Coin is becoming a notable story in the crypto world. However, their rapid ascents are often accompanied by swift declines. So, is there more room for Pepe Coin to grow?
What Does the Pepe Coin Chart Indicate?
The price stabilization and consolidation of the meme coin Pepe Coin indicate that the market is currently in an early bull run phase. Particularly, the consolidation of Pepe Coin after a 650% increase summarizes the extraordinary volatility in the market. However, this situation implies that Pepe Coin’s value is likely to increase further in the coming days. Yet, the MACD indicator has not shown signs of recovery for Pepe after the decline.

Pepe Coin could potentially exhibit a 60% increase, reaching levels of $0.0000104, especially with the renewed enthusiasm around meme coins. This indicates that Pepe Coin could surpass previous resistance levels and climb to new highs. Analysts predict that Pepe Coin could reach these price levels by January 2026, but this timeline could change depending on market volatility.
The Rise of Pepe Coin Energizes Other Meme Coins
In the cryptocurrency market, the rise of Pepe Coin is overshadowing other meme coins, particularly Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. This situation shows that Pepe Coin is in a strong position in the market and is attracting investor interest. Its rapid increase in value has placed it among the top 50 crypto assets by market value, and according to analysts, this rise could just be the beginning.
The current volatility in the crypto market suggests that after Bitcoin‘s consolidation, the dynamics of altcoins have become more pronounced. This allows previously overlooked or low-volume crypto assets to attract attention and potentially experience significant growth in the future.
The rise of Pepe Coin points to an exciting narrative in the world of cryptocurrency. However, it’s important to remember that meme coins are risky assets at this stage. It’s also worth noting that the main promise of such projects is their price potential. At the time of writing, Pepe Coin is trading at $0.00000676.

The cryptocurrency market continues to maintain its upward momentum, with some coins, notably The Sandbox (SAND), displaying promising growth patterns. Investors are curious if the current crypto bull market has room for new entries. Analyst Ali Martinez asserts that opportunities still exist, highlighting SAND’s untapped potential. Martinez’s insights come amid a broader industry interest in the metaverse and blockchain gaming, with SAND gaining traction.
Insights from Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez
Martinez underscores the notion that the cryptocurrency sector has yet to fully actualize its possibilities. On the social platform X, he noted that SAND hasn’t breached the 78.6 Fibonacci retracement level—a key indicator often associated with future price direction changes. This observation suggests SAND could see more price appreciation as it attempts to rebound from its previous highs.
SAND’s recovery journey is closely monitored, especially as the 78.6% level poses a significant resistance point for the digital asset. The token’s performance is further bolstered by recent interest spikes following partnerships with prominent brands like Gucci and the historical drama series ‘Magnificent Century.’ The entry of luxury brand Gucci into the Sandbox metaverse, purchasing virtual land, is a significant endorsement for the platform.
Positive Trends in SAND’s Market Value
Current market data from March 7, 2024, aligns with Martinez’s predictions. SAND has managed to climb back to the $0.7 mark, enjoying a 2.92% rise within the past day. The token’s week-long increase of 18.40% and a monthly surge of 60.79% indicate that the latest price climb is not merely coincidental but part of a larger, positive trend.
The consistent interest in virtual environments and blockchain-based gaming platforms is driving speculation that SAND and similar tokens could experience further valuation increases. As the metaverse continues to attract attention and investment, SAND’s position as a leading metaverse altcoin could signal further growth opportunities for investors.

DeeStream (DST) is the first decentralized streaming platform to ever be made. They plan to take over the streaming industry which is currently valued at $160.55 billion and is expected to reach $247 billion by 2027.

Then when it comes to their creators, they plan to have lower fees than traditional platforms as well as less strict guidelines when it comes to creating and streaming content. They also plan to have an instant withdrawal button so that their creators can have access to their funds whenever they wish.
Finally, DeeStream (DST) promises a lot of returns for their investors, for example, everyone who is a presale token holder gets to receive a share of platform revenue for as long as they hold the tokens. Every investor and holder also gets to participate in decision-making and helps decide what gets added and changed on the platform to keep it growing.
All these factors, and many more including the fact that DeeStream (DST) has recently passed audit and plans to lock liquidity for the life of the project. It feels like a surprise that the presale price is still only $0.04.

Of these movements, there is one that really stands out and can even be considered trailblazing in the industry of online marketplace: Pushd (PUSHD), with its decentralized approach and the promise for opportunities in growth.
Solana (SOL) Ecosystem Energized by Meme Coins 
Meme coins are born in its network, reviving the ecosystem of Solana (SOL). Of all these, meme coins born on Solana (SOL)—especially BONK (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF)—have gained tremendous attention, so they have added fuel to the Solana (SOL) price rally. First launched to make up for the investors at the time, the price of SOL Coin was very low. BONK (BONK) has made massive gains for the patient holders. On the other hand, recently debuting on Binance, Dogwifhat (WIF) made an amazing 38% gain in price within only 24 hours.
The blistering gains of meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF) were just more examples of the excitement within the Solana (SOL) community that has set it on fire and thrown it up into the limelight as an epicenter for cryptocurrency projects.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Rally and On-Chain Activity
Dogecoin (DOGE) has exploded to levels not seen in the past three years amid notable on-chain activity, especially from whale investors. The on-chain activity indicated a rise in holdings of the whale wallet, which primarily caused the explosion to the said price level, corresponding to strong bullish signals and signs of investor confidence. The short overtake of Cardano on market capitalization aside, if the rally of Dogecoin (DOGE), which could momentarily overtake Cardano at one of its peaks, emphasizes the explosive nature of meme coins and hence, calls for caution, the technical analysis continues. Indications are that impulses and corrections have more upward potential at key support and resistance levels.
Ethereum (ETH) Surge Signals Market Resilience 
Ethereum (ETH) rallied massively above the $3900 level in gigantic market volatility, with the support level retested over time; no doubt that the surge of such nature showcases nothing else but the inherent strength of Ethereum (ETH). By splitting the price movements, the divergence in Ethereum’s path points out independent trajectories increasingly coming into play for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. A basket of strong growth metrics, together with increasing institutional interest, is in some way, using valuation as a barometer of market sentiment to steer broader dynamics of the market.
Pushd (PUSHD): Pioneering Decentralized Online Marketplace 
Riding high in this new development is Pushd (PUSHD), which is one of the new players in the modern Web3 marketplace. Working off the traditional online marketplace model popular with the likes of Amazon or eBay, Pushd (PUSHD) has an added advantage as it is decentralized. It offers clear, secure and transparent value. With the global e-commerce industry projected at $4 trillion in the year 2024, Pushd (PUSHD) stakes its claim to not be left behind in the wake of such an ever-rising industry.

Unlocking Potential: DeeStream (DST) Presale Hype Surges with Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) Bulls Joining the Frenzy,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 00:58:08.397203,"DeeStream (DST) has hit the ground running. The new streaming coin, still in stage 1 of its presale, has caused a frenzy in the crypto market. With the Bitcoin (BTC) rally and the rise of various altcoins, investors can expect massive profits from their investments, yet it is DeeStream (DST) that is attracting a lot of hype. 
Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have returned a profit in the last week, but with the potential for more significant profit margins available on DeeStream (DST), Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) holders are joining the DeeStream (DST) ride. Here is why.
Avalanche (AVAX) chasing $50
Avalanche (AVAX) could be riding towards $50. The coin, which CoinMarketCap ranks as number 11 by market capitalization, has enjoyed an increase of 15.97% in the past month. 
Avalanche (AVAX) has broken past the $40 barrier and is selling at $41.04, representing a 3.65% increase in the last 7 days.
There is, however, a bearish feeling among several investors who judge that its rise last month is not convincing enough and, therefore, seek better alternatives. 
The future of Chainlink (LINK) is uncertain
Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum to facilitate secure cross-chain communications. It is the 14th largest crypto by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.
Chainlink (LINK) has barely risen in the past 7 days, increasing by 0.81%. Over an extended period of 30 days, it has gained 5.08%. It had previously risen above $20 but has retraced and is currently trading at $19.68.
Experts believe that the prospects of Chainlink (LINK) are uncertain, and the coming weeks will provide better guidance on what is next to do. 
DeeStream (DST) is worth the hype
There is no smoke without fire, but with DeeStream (DST), it seems the hype does not do enough justice to the coin.
DeeStream (DST) is the world’s first fully decentralized streaming platform. It utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure peer-to-peer network where content creators and their fans can interact from anywhere. 
DeeStream (DST) aims to change how video content is created, shared and consumed. Being built on the blockchain gives DeeStream (DST) the advantage of providing an honest and transparent marketplace. 
DeeStream (DST) offers presale token holders a share of the revenue generated on the platform that is proportional to their holdings as long as they keep their tokens. All presale token holders can suggest changes and contribute to how the platform runs.
With the potential for significant profit margins and up to 50x returns, DeeStream (DST) is an excellent opportunity for investors and a token is selling for just $0.04, meaning it is available for a giveaway price.
We believe DeeStream (DST) could be the next blue-chip crypto, but in any case, it has the potential to rise very high.

Amid the bull run, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge and altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) following closely, DeeStream (DST) is making a name for itself and pioneering the introduction of web3 technology to video streaming.
We look at the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), and what makes DeeStream (DST) stand out as an excellent investment opportunity.
Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time high
Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising in recent times and even reached a new all-time high before retracing back. Bitcoin (BTC) grew by more than 55% in the last month, according to CoinMarketCap. The approval of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by US regulators has driven its price upward. With the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event happening next month, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to grow even further.
Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $66,748.48, representing a 10.55% increase in value in the last 7 days.
Ethereum (ETH) a close second
Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind Bitcoin (BTC). Ethereum (ETH) is charging towards the $4,000 mark, and there is growing belief that it might surpass it soon. With the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a surge in value and is currently trading at $3,849.62, a more than 64% increase over the last month. 
Ethereum (ETH) is still a good while away from its all-time high, but experts believe it can go beyond this year.
DeeStream (DST) is solving streaming problems
Centralized streaming platforms like YouTube, Kick and Twitch are often limited, and transaction fees can sometimes cost a fortune. These platforms can sometimes restrict how creators express themselves because of fear of censorship. Also, users will have to wait long before their funds are released.
DeeStream (DST) comes as a better alternative to these platforms. With blockchain technology, DeeStream (DST) can provide a safe and secure platform for content creators and their users. Being a decentralized platform, DeeStream (DST) allows users to express their creativity as much as they desire. The platform would never ban users who share their opinions. 
DeeStream (DST) also offers instant deposits and withdrawals, meaning as soon as users request their funds, it is released without delays. DeeStream (DST) also charges the lowest transaction fees in the industry, meaning it is very affordable for creators, and they can make a good profit.
With a token of DeeStream (DST) selling for $0.04, it is a unique and cheap opportunity for investors to be a part of a potential blue-chip cryptocurrency while it is still in its early stages.

DeeStream (DST) Presale Skyrockets Whilst Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) Holders Join the Thriving Streaming Platform,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 00:58:11.154276,"The surging crypto market has created a situation where projects have started to see their prices rise over the last few months. This means that investors have to find which projects are going to be valuable in the long run. As a result, good investors have to keep an eye out for projects whose value propositions solve problems for real people in a real market.
Now let’s take a look at three projects that investors have been keeping an eye out for over the last few weeks of the bull run: Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT) and DeeStream (DST), the world’s first-ever decentralized streaming platform.
Solana (SOL) charting nicely
A look at the charts for Solana (SOL) over the last few months shows a lot of green. Short-term traders have seen the price increase by 15.86% in the last week and 35.10% in the last month. Further down the charts, one can see that Solana’s price has risen by 516% in the last year.
Tether (USDT)
For Tether (USDT) holders, on the other hand, all they care about is that it remains stable. Luckily for them, it has been stable with price fluctuations of only about 0.05% in the last seven days and  0.11% in the last year.
DeeStream (DST)
So let’s take a look at the project that has Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) holders looking to invest in its presale because of how much they expect the project to appreciate by in the coming days.
DeeStream (DST) is the world’s first-ever decentralized streaming platform and plans to reinvent how people see streaming. One of the major attractive features of DeeStream (DST) is that the streaming market is currently valued at $160.55 billion and is expected to be valued at $247 billion by 2027.
DeeStream (DST) plans to take over by fixing the problems they think exist in the streaming industry today. For growth, they plan to grow the platform by rewarding the users for performing certain tasks that help improve brand perception and awareness.
Then when it comes to the creators DeeStream (DST) plans to have less strict guidelines for creating and streaming content as well as take lower fees from their creators than traditional platforms. They also plan to have an instant withdrawal button so that their creators have access to their funds whenever they need to.
When it comes to their investors, DeeStream (DST) plans to ensure that every investor gets a share of platform revenue for as long as they hold presale tokens. Every presale token holder and investor will also help decide what gets added and changed on the platform.
DeeStream (DST) has also passed audits and plans to have the project liquidity locked for life and the team’s liquidity locked for a thousand days.
When you look at all these factors it feels like a shock to find out the presale price is still only $0.04 for stage one. In all, the best time to get into a good crypto project is early in the life of the project and that’s why we think that you should check out DeeStream (DST) today.

"DeeStream (DST) Dominates Early March: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) Whales Dive into the Presale, Ripple (XRP) Holds Strong",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 00:58:12.557404,"Shareholders of crypto projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) are looking to invest in DeeStream (DST). The decentralized streaming platform has grown from $0.035 to $0.040 in just the first few days of March. And shareholders of other crypto projects have taken notice.
Bitcoin (BTC) investors are seeing the growth and price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) towards $70,000. There’s confidence that Bitcoin (BTC) will not only match its previous record-breaking price point but will surpass it. 
Many in the industry believe that this will be the year that Bitcoin goes mainstream. Ripple (XRP), like many other crypto projects below Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), rises with the tide of the big giants as they head for the moon.
Bitcoin (BTC) Price Movements Suggest Mainstream Adoption
Even with the crypto hype of the early 2020s, many haven’t heard or gotten familiar with Bitcoin (BTC) which is by far the most popular cryptocurrency. 
Yes, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $70,000 in 2021 but that didn’t mean people on the street talked about it. Doubt your grandpa has Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in his portfolio. But with the coming of ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC), it’s clear where the mainstream financial markets are going with this development.
Bitcoin (BTC) is about to be the prime financial term on Wall Street. Currently trading at around $66K, Bitcoin (BTC) has been on the rise from its price value at the beginning of last month which was $43,000, to its value a week ago at $59,000.
Ripple (XRP) Rising Off Of The Ripple Effect
Ripple Labs built the payment platform RippleNet to support the cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP). This crypto project focuses fully on fast and secure payment transactions. Although it has a blockchain, Ripple (XRP) works well because its policy is to bring decentralized features to centralized institutions such as banks.
Ripple has had its fair share of turbulence. Some crypto enthusiasts who view decentralization as a fundamental principle don’t necessarily see Ripple (XRP) as a project that represents bucking the system. The SEC has been in court to sanction Ripple (XRP) for its alleged breach of financial regulation.
The price of Ripple (XRP) took a beat down at that point not just for the controversy but the general cold winds of crypto winter that swept through the entire industry. Optimism is back as with it the rise in value for many crypto projects. 
Ripple (XRP) is one of them. It traded at $0.6119 today and $0.5891 a week ago, which is a steady rise from its $0.5052 price value last month.
DeeStream (DST) Dominating The Price Charts
DeeStream (DST) brings user and investor advantages that give it the potential for outsized returns in the future. It currently trades for $0.040 and is expected to grow by at least 20x its value today in the next few months.
DeeStream (DST) brings with it a payment platform that helps fans support their streamers. There are instant payouts and freedom of speech for professional content creators looking for a stable streaming platform. 
Investors, on the other hand, get governance rights and a 50:50 revenue split if they can buy in early with the DeeStream (DST) presale launch event.

The Pushd (PUSHD) Presale Success: Chainlink (LINK) and Bitcoin (BTC) Bulls Embrace the New Age of Online Marketplaces,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-08 00:58:22.687714,"Nearing the successful conclusion of the Pushd (PUSHD) presale, optimism continued to converge from the Chainlink (LINK) and Bitcoin (BTC) communities. In the midst of this building optimism, online marketplaces are ushered into an age of innovation and decentralization.
The growth potential of Chainlink (LINK), combined with its usability on Bitcoin (BTC) platforms, makes Pushd (PUSHD) a roaring promise of turning these very platforms on their heads. Read below on how it aims to change the dynamics of a marketplace.
Chainlink (LINK): Potential for Remarkable Growth
Thus, even a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, HBARI, in one of his works, always comes up with interesting analogies between the market behaviors of Chainlink (LINK) and historical data about Ethereum (ETH). A further deep analysis shows that Chainlink (LINK) is following many of the patterns Ethereum (ETH) has shown before entering its parabolic run. Comparing Chainlink’s current position to Ethereum (ETH) at the same time last year, HBARI estimates a likely Chainlink (LINK) peak of around $150 should USD-denominated longs reach their 4.236 Fibonacci extension.
This has underlined the potential for not only massive price appreciation but also hints at the implications in the market cap sizeable enough that it can propel Chainlink (LINK) easily into the realm of $82-88 billion.
Bitcoin (BTC): Volatility Amidst Surge
Bitcoin (BTC) flash-crashed as much as 23.7% against the euro within mere seconds on Coinbase. The event comes after Bitcoin (BTC) had set a new all-time high at $69,325 and clearly demonstrated how reality is quite the opposite: that of inherent volatility characterizing the crypto market. Despite the flash crash, Bitcoin (BTC) swiftly rebounded, highlighting the resilience of the leading cryptocurrency.
Pushd (PUSHD): Pioneering the Future of Online Marketplaces
In these markets, Pushd (PUSHD) emerges in the leading position of the online marketplace industry. Such a model sharply sets Pushd (PUSHD) apart from traditional platforms like Amazon or eBay because of its decentralized nature, full transparency and solid security, with users poised to take charge of their online purchases. The present market valuation of the global e-commerce sector should reach $4 trillion at the close of 2024 and Pushd (PUSHD) is pacing at the front of this growing industry.
The decentralized approach of the platform helps bring the buyers and sellers onto a seamless platform, which charges way cheaper fees, instant deposit and withdrawal and easier processes for all vendors to list with.
All investors who are ready to be part of this great and promising ecosystem are invited to the presale, which is already in stage 5 with a very friendly price of only $0.11. Moreover, with blockchain technology in place to offer the requisite assurance, Pushd (PUSHD) assures its clientele of a safe, reliable and efficient market experience when transacting within the ecosystem.

The cryptocurrency sector is experiencing positive momentum as of Thursday, March 7, 2024, with some projects showing signs of a rising trajectory. The market conditions priced in dollars do not seem to be slowing down in March either. Investors continue to seek answers to one of the most frequently asked questions during bull markets: Is it too late to get into the crypto market? Analyst Ali Martinez points out that this is not the case and draws attention to the past bull market star, The Sandbox (SAND).
Analyst’s Comments on SAND
According to Martinez, the crypto industry is still far from reaching its full potential. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the popular user emphasized that SAND has not yet surpassed the 78.6 Fibonacci level, which traders believe could signal a change in price direction.

When people say it’s too late to get into the crypto market… They claim a peak is near! Bruf, SAND hasn’t even passed the 78.6 Fib level yet. This is the biggest metaverse altcoin in the sector!


The 78.6 level is thought to be particularly emphasized because it indicates a deep retracement level. SAND has experienced a significant pullback from its past peak and is currently in an effort to recover.
The 78.6% level mentioned by Martinez continues to be a barrier that may need to be overcome for the token price to start rising.
Martinez’s statement comes right after an increase in interest in the metaverse platform’s native token and the establishment of new partnerships with projects like Gucci, Magnificent Century.
Gucci’s purchase of digital real estate on Sandbox (SAND) is seen as a market signal confirming the value of Sandbox and its notable role in the metaverse space.
The growing interest in virtual worlds and blockchain-supported games suggests that such moves could herald further price increases in the future.
SAND Price Outlook
Data emerging on March 7, 2024, appears to be in line with Ali Martinez’s hypothetical view. As of the time of writing, SAND has returned to the $0.7 level after a long period. This price indicates a 2.92% increase over the last 24 hours.
The metaverse token has seen a value increase of 18.40% over the last 7 days and 60.79% over the last month, demonstrating that today’s rise is not just a matter of chance.

New Bitcoin Alternative With 10X Potential Hits $2.2 Million in Presale – Best Low Cap Crypto to Invest In,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 00:58:25.536259,"
Green Bitcoin stands out as a top low-cap crypto project with its unique staking platform, enabling users to earn rewards by predicting Bitcoin prices.
With the crypto market witnessing another notable uptrend, investors are seeking fresh opportunities to capitalize on the surge. Bitcoin has demonstrated impressive growth, climbing over 11% in the past week and surpassing the crucial $65k mark in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April 2024.
Amidst this renewed interest, a newcomer named Green Bitcoin has garnered attention during its presale phase, raising over $2 million. Notably, it promotes environmentally conscious Features, positioning itself as a green alternative within the crypto community, offering eco-friendliness 10,000 times greater than Bitcoin.
This article aims to provide comprehensive insights into the project, covering essential aspects such as earning opportunities through Bitcoin price forecasting and a thorough overview of the $GBTC presale.
Green Bitcoin – Eco-Conscious Staking for Sustainable Rewards
Green Bitcoin, an ERC-20 token, combines the best of both worlds in the crypto market, being strong within the crypto community, environmentally conscious, and offering a rewarding staking system.
This leads to the concept of ‘Gamified Green Staking,’ a design idea that promises big returns and potential token bonuses of up to 100%. The project introduces a unique approach to crypto mechanics by combining Bitcoin’s legacy with Ethereum’s eco-friendly architecture.
The ‘green’ approach also applies to the staking process – accurate predictions that hit a specific green target trigger extra staking bonuses. Users stake $GBTC, track Bitcoin’s price trends and predictions, and wait for the staking period to end before claiming their rewards.





As detailed in Green Bitcoin’s whitepaper, 27.5% of the total $GBTC supply is allocated to staking rewards gradually distributed over two years. Each day, this $GBTC pool is divided among accurate predictors, encouraging regular participation.
Longer staking periods offer additional bonuses on rewards for those holding long-term. Additionally, its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method requires only a fraction of the energy used in Bitcoin mining. It also Features engaging weekly prediction contests.
The current staking Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is 171% with over 3.3 million $GBTC already staked. With its unique Features, Green Bitcoin stands out as a distinct project poised to make a significant impact upon its exchange debut. Check out our article for the $GBTC price prediction for 2024 here.
To delve deeper into the Green Bitcoin presale, watch the video provided above and follow his YouTube channel for more crypto-related videos. Additionally, Jacob Crypto Bury manages a Discord community with 21,000 members, where users can obtain trading tips and insights into upcoming crypto presales.
Green Bitcoin’s $GBTC Token Presale Success and Future Roadmap
The Green Bitcoin token presale has already amassed a substantial $2.2 million and has progressed through several phases now priced at $0.6882 per token. The presale has allocated 40% of the total $GBTC token supply, with 27.5% reserved for staking rewards.
Marketing receives 17.5%, community rewards account for 5%, and liquidity holds 10% of the supply. The project’s “Green Map” initiative aims to improve the platform’s gamified elements, enhancing the staking experience for users. Potential buyers can visit our guide on how to buy Green Bitcoin token here.

Following the presale, the team will prioritize key objectives such as implementing staking and prediction Features. The overarching aim is to cultivate a community bound by eco-friendly principles, all while enabling individuals to earn passive crypto income.
Significantly, the smart contracts of Green Bitcoin recently underwent a thorough audit performed by Coinsult, a blockchain security company. Once the token is listed on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), efforts will be directed towards expanding the community and ecosystem.
With its green Features and staking rewards, the $GBTC token holds significant growth potential post-presale. Further information will be disclosed in the coming weeks. We recommend following Green Bitcoin’s Telegram channel and X account (formerly Twitter) to stay updated. To take part in the $GBTC presale visit greenbitcoin.xyx.

"Optimism Price Prediction for Today, March 7 – OP Technical Analysis",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 00:58:27.342124,"
The Optimism price prediction shows that OP is gaining more strength as the coin crosses above the moving averages.
Optimism (OP) Achieves Record High, Soars to $4.66 in Dramatic Surge
All OP token holders are currently profitable based on the current price, as indicated by data from on-chain analyst IntoTheBlock. The token’s price has surged recently, with the highest-paid price reaching 4.01% before reaching its latest milestone. This price increase corresponds with the rising popularity of L2 scaling solutions, benefiting OP token as one of the leading L2 solutions in the market.
Optimism Prediction Statistics Data:

Optimism price now – $4.35
Optimism market cap – $4.69 billion
Optimism circulating supply – 4.29 billion
Optimism total supply – 4.29 billion
Optimism Coinmarketcap ranking – #29

OP/USD Market
Key Levels:
Resistance levels: $5.50, $6.00, $6.50
Support levels: $3.00, $2.50, $2.00




   OPUSD – Daily Chart
  

OP/USD may continue to refresh to the upside as the coin currently trades at $4.35 with a bullish crossover and trend intraday. Today, the Optimism price is facing the upper boundary of the channel as higher resistance may come in the next positive direction.
Optimism Price Prediction: Optimism Price May Spike to the Upside
The Optimism price is likely to increase the bullish movement if the price increases and heads toward the upper boundary of the channel. Currently, the 9-day moving average is likely to cross above the 21-day moving average; it could send bullish signals into the market to encourage more buyers.
Meanwhile, as soon as the bulls increase the buying pressure, it is for the confirmation that the coin will head to the north, and the Optimism price could hit the nearest resistance levels at $5.50, $6.00, and $6.50 respectively. On the contrary, if the 9-day MA slides below the 21-day MA, there may be a little retreat to the south, bringing the market price to the support levels of $3.00, $2.50, and $2.00.
OP/BTC Keeps Ranging
Against Bitcoin, Optimism (OP) may cross above the 21-day moving average as the price heads to the upside. Meanwhile, the fact that the market keeps moving in the same direction within the channel, the crypto is likely to form a bullish movement if the 9-day moving average crosses above the 21-day moving average.




   OPBTC – Daily Chart
  

Nevertheless, if the buyers push the market price toward the upper boundary of the channel, crossing above this barrier could hit the resistance level of 9179 SAT and above. Meanwhile, traders should watch out for any strong selling pressure that could bring the price below the lower boundary of the channel, this could attract new sellers coming into the market with the next focus on the support level of 3800 SAT and below.
However, @AltcoinSherpa shared with his 210k followers on X (formerly Twitter) that $OP appears more favorable compared to $ARB at the moment. OP is currently experiencing a clear price discovery phase and seems to be taking the lead, with ARB expected to follow suit shortly. Nonetheless, OP is likely the stronger contender, making it the preferred choice for investment.

ETH beta: I think that $OP looks better than $ARB right now. OP in clean price discovery and looks to be leading; ARB likely to catch up soon. But OP is probably the better bet as its shown more strength pic.twitter.com/iJHT59MDG2

Alternatives to Optimism
Optimism (OP) shows signs of potential bullish momentum near its upper channel boundary, with traders anticipating a continuation of the trend. Additionally, the emergence of a new resistance level is suggested by the 9-day moving average crossing above the 21-day moving average. Despite Optimism’s established position with a market cap of $4.69 billion in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) presents an attractive investment opportunity with its substantial presale stage valuation exceeding $11.8 million, indicating promising growth potential.

Recent trends in the cryptocurrency market hint at the possible commencement of an “altcoin season,” a term used to describe a market phase where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Analysis of the top 50 crypto assets reveals a majority have exceeded Bitcoin’s growth in the last season, suggesting a shift in investor focus towards altcoins. Blockchain Center’s dedicated index, which tracks this phenomenon, signals that 75% of the leading altcoins outshone Bitcoin, hinting at a bullish sentiment for these digital assets.
Understanding Altcoin Season Dynamics
Despite these optimistic signs, the index also shows that, in the past 90 days, only 69% of top altcoin projects surpassed Bitcoin, a percentage that is notable but not definitive of an altcoin season. Market analysts from K33 Research provide a more hopeful perspective, drawing parallels between the current market setup and the altcoin bull run of 2020. They predict a similar pattern where altcoin values could escalate following Bitcoin’s lead towards its all-time high.
Expert Opinions and Predictive Scenarios
Notable market analysts have offered their insights into the relationship between Bitcoin’s price movements and the kickoff of the altcoin season. CrediBULL, an independent analyst, contemplates two scenarios: one where Bitcoin rapidly doubles its value, overshadowing altcoins, and another where Bitcoin consolidates after reaching peak levels, allowing altcoins to gain momentum. Michael van de Poppe, a leading trading consultant, however, tempers expectations by reminding that altcoins have yet to reclaim 40-60% of their market value from the peaks of 2021.
Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, offers a more tangible milestone, suggesting that the overtaking of Cardano’s market value by DOGE would signal the definitive start of the altcoin season. These varied perspectives underline the complex interplay of market forces that could dictate the trajectory of the altcoin market in the near future.
While the exact timing and conditions of the upcoming altcoin season remain uncertain, the increasing performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, coupled with expert analyses and historical patterns, provide a compelling narrative for investors looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios.

Philippine central banker reveals details about wCBDC pilot project,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-08 00:58:30.672588,"An official of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) has revealed more details about the central bank’s plans for to study wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC), according to a local press report.
BSP deputy governor for payments and currency management sector Mamerto Tangonan told a press conference on March 6 that the wCBDC pilot project, called Project Agila, would be completed by the end of this year. Tangonan called the pilot project a “learning exercise.” Tangonan said:

 “We envision a Philippines where access to securities and similar investment instruments can be democratized, meaning they could be purchased for smaller issue sizes and much much lower fees so that any Juan or Maria cannot only dream but actually own securities.”

Six domestic banks — BDO Unibank, China Banking Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Union Bank of the Philippines and Maya Philippines — are taking part in pilot along with the BSP. The project is using the wCBDC to transfer funds among the banks.

“But we also like to see if this wholesale CBDC can be used for higher value-adding services like securities settlement,” Tangonan added.
BSP governor Eli Remolona told the press in February that the central bank was only considering a wCBDC, due to concerns about bank disintermediation and similar issues associated with the potential issuance of a retail CBDC. The CBDC would not operate on a blockchain, he added.

The Philippines first announced its interest in issuing a CBDC in 2020. The BSP Monetary Board noted the bank’s positive initial assessment of a wCBDC and planned pilot tests beginning in 2022. It was known at that time as Project CBDCPh. The launch of a pilot project was announced in April 2022.
The Philippines took part in a pilot study in 2023 involving the Digital Dollar Project, Western Union and BDO Unibank to study retail CBDC for use in remittances. They found that the proposed CBDC would lower costs and increase transparency and competition. The project was challenged to improve the speed of transactions, however, since most remittances come into the Philippines after working hours.

"Bitcoin Firmly in the Pre-Halving Rally Phase, According to Analyst – But There’s a Catch",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 00:58:32.411422,"
A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is currently decisively in the midst of its pre-halving rally.
Pseudonymous crypto strategist Rekt Capital tells his 410,900 followers on the social media platform X that despite this, the top crypto asset by market cap could still see some dips along the way.
  

“Bitcoin is still firmly in its pre-halving rally phase but as is the case with pre-halving rallies – dips can happen. Bitcoin briefly dipped -14% yesterday. The best we can hope for are these dips, but be careful what you wish for – dips do happen.”


   Source: Rekt Capital/X
  

The trader’s chart indicates that during the 2020 cycle, Bitcoin went through a post-halving slump before going parabolic – something that he predicts will happen again this year.
BTC’s next halving event is slated for April and will see miners’ rewards cut in half. The crypto king is trading for $67,200 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to dog-themed digital asset Dogecoin (DOGE), Rekt Capital says that the popular memecoin has confirmed a new macro uptrend after successfully retesting its support level.
“DOGE has successfully retested the macro downtrend as new support. A successful retest after just breaking a macro downtrend means that a new macro uptrend has been fully confirmed.”

The trader’s chart shows that Dogecoin could shoot past the $0.20 price tag before June. DOGE is trading for $0.153 at time of writing, a 2.5% increase during the last day.

Injective Surges Following Major Integration: Analysts Predict INJ’s Breakthrough to This Next Price Level,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-08 00:58:34.235754,"The price of decentralized trading protocol Injective (INJ) has risen sharply over the past 24 hours, driven by growing optimism among analysts and news of a significant integration. According to data from CoinMarketCap, INJ trades at $43.06, up by over 12% in the past day. 
Analysts’ Perspectives
Several factors appear to be contributing to Injective’s upside momentum. Top crypto analyst CryptoJelleNL had noted in a tweet over a week ago that after breaking out of a prolonged downtrend and recording new highs, INJ had established bullish market structure again. He expressed confidence that the altcoin was preparing for its next big leg higher and estimated its price could surge past the key $50 resistance level in the near future, if bullish conditions remained intact.

His upbeat analysis was echoed by fellow trader Crypto Tony in a tweet, where he pointed to INJ’s price chart to underline that a fresh record high seemed imminent based on the strengthening trend.



Injective’s gains were further propelled by the announcement of its first major integration outside of the Ethereum network. The announcement revealed exclusive support for Ethena’s algorithmic stablecoin USDe, marking the first partnership for Ethena beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. The integration effectively brings USDe to Injective’s order book platform and wider Inter-Blockchain Communication community.
Prateek Tripathi, a top figure in crypto, in a tweet, noted the integration would allow developers to utilize the advantages of USDe’s algorithmic design on their applications. The exclusivity of the partnership is a potential vote of confidence in Injective.
The Potential for New Highs
Analysts believe the confluence of encouraging technical signals, bullish price predictions and the high-profile integration news have energized INJ investors. If it sustains its upward trajectory over the coming sessions, the cryptocurrency could challenge CryptoJelleNL’s $50 target before long.

Zircuit Staking Program Breaks $500M TVL And Adds Ethena Integration,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-08 00:58:36.090852,"
George Town, Grand Cayman, March 7th, 2024, Chainwire
Zircuit, a zk rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level, today announced its staking program has surpassed $500M in TVL. Currently in testnet phase, Zircuit is poised to hit a mainnet TVL on day one that surpasses major blockchains such as Linea, Manta, Mantle, Near, Scroll, Aptos, and zkSync.
Next week, Zircuit will integrate Ethena, adding to its growing list of supported protocols for Zircuit Staking. Users who stake USDe with Zircuit will earn Zircuit Points and 7x Shards (Ethena points). Ethena is a crypto-native solution to a yield-bearing synthetic dollar fully collateralized and freely composable onchain. Other protocols in the program include Renzo, Kelp, Etherfi, Lido, Swell, Eigenpie, and Liquid Collective.
Points programs have become a rising trend in crypto, offering a new way to incentivize users who contribute to a protocol. Zircuit Staking is an innovative program that allows users to deposit ETH, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) to earn Zircuit Points. Through the staking program, users can earn Zircuit points on top of any staking yield or points they are already earning. Users who opt-in to migrate their assets to the Zircuit Mainnet when it goes live are rewarded the most. Users can withdraw at any time and keep the points and yield earned, as ETH isn’t hard-locked like Blast or Mantle.
After spending over a year and a half conducting L2 research, the Zircuit team created an L2 with a built-in AI-enabled sequencer that protects users by monitoring the mempool for malicious transactions. In comparison to typical security efforts that focus on the application and smart contract levels, Zircuit brings sequencer-level security (SLS). This means that every transaction on Zircuit will go through low-level security checks resulting in a more secure chain for projects and end users. Zircuit is also fully EVM-compatible, offers greater efficiency, and provides users with cheaper and faster transactions.
Backed by Pantera Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom, Zircuit is currently in testnet phase with mainnet expected to come later in 2024. To participate in Zircuit Staking, users can visit: https://stake.zircuit.com/
About Zircuit
Zircuit is a zk rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level. Built by a team of web3 security veterans and PhDs in computer science, algorithms, and cryptography, Zircuit’s unique architecture combines the best of both worlds of performance and security.

Signs of an Upcoming Altcoin Season,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-08 00:58:37.886476,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Signs of an Upcoming Altcoin Season
Altcoin projects’ performance coincided with improvements in the altcoin season index, indicating the proximity of an altcoin season. According to an index prepared by Blockchain Center, 75% of the top 50 crypto assets performed better than Bitcoin in the last season, strengthening this possibility.
Comments on the Altcoin Season
This indicator essentially reveals that only 69% of the leading 50 altcoin projects performed better than Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Although the index has increased in the past few days, there is still not enough data to declare an altcoin season.

However, according to a new market report by K33 Research, this situation may soon change. The report notes that since the November 2022 low, Bitcoin’s rise towards its all-time high has doubled the market value of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. K33 Research analysts said that the setup reflects the 2020 altcoin bull run just before Bitcoin caught up with the uptrend:

“History suggests that altcoin projects will start performing better from the current period.”


Noteworthy Statements from Prominent Figures
Independent analyst CrediBULL explored the connection between Bitcoin’s performance and the start of the altcoin season. In an article published on March 4th at X, CrediBULL summarizes two possible scenarios:
One where Bitcoin breaks its previous ATH level and doubles in value within a few weeks, and during this breakout leg, altcoin projects are not favored until Bitcoin pauses; and a consolidation scenario where Bitcoin returns to its previous ATH level but faces rejection or consolidates at the highest levels for several weeks. In the second case, altcoin projects start to rise immediately after Bitcoin tags its ATH level. CrediBull commented on the matter:

“The common theme and key takeaway is that after Bitcoin reaches its previous ATH level, altcoins begin to rise during Bitcoin’s first major pause or consolidation, whether at the previous ATH level or well above it.”

Nevertheless, Michael van de Poppe, founder and CEO of MN Trading Consultancy, believes that the altcoin season has not yet started and points out that they still have a market value of 40-60% before reaching the 2021 peaks of over $1.1 trillion.

Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson believes that the altcoin season will start with DOGE surpassing ADA in market value. Hoskinson said in a post on X social media platform on March 5th:

“The moment DOGE passes Cardano. That’s officially altcoin season, guys.”

With the crypto market witnessing another notable uptrend, investors are seeking fresh opportunities to capitalize on the surge. Bitcoin has demonstrated impressive growth, climbing over 11% in the past week and surpassing the crucial $65k mark in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April 2024.
Amidst this renewed interest, a newcomer named Green Bitcoin has garnered attention during its presale phase, raising over $2 million. Notably, it promotes environmentally conscious features, positioning itself as a green alternative within the crypto community, offering eco-friendliness 10,000 times greater than Bitcoin.
This article aims to provide comprehensive insights into the project, covering essential aspects such as earning opportunities through Bitcoin price forecasting and a thorough overview of the $GBTC presale.
Green Bitcoin – Eco-Conscious Staking for Sustainable Rewards
Green Bitcoin, an ERC-20 token, combines the best of both worlds in the crypto market, being strong within the crypto community, environmentally conscious, and offering a rewarding staking system.
This leads to the concept of ‘Gamified Green Staking,’ a design idea that promises big returns and potential token bonuses of up to 100%. The project introduces a unique approach to crypto mechanics by combining Bitcoin’s legacy with Ethereum’s eco-friendly architecture.
The ‘green’ approach also applies to the staking process – accurate predictions that hit a specific green target trigger extra staking bonuses. Users stake $GBTC, track Bitcoin’s price trends and predictions, and wait for the staking period to end before claiming their rewards.

As detailed in Green Bitcoin’s whitepaper, 27.5% of the total $GBTC supply is allocated to staking rewards gradually distributed over two years. Each day, this $GBTC pool is divided among accurate predictors, encouraging regular participation.
Longer staking periods offer additional bonuses on rewards for those holding long-term. Additionally, its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method requires only a fraction of the energy used in Bitcoin mining. It also features engaging weekly prediction contests.
The current staking Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is 171% with over 3.3 million $GBTC already staked. With its unique features, Green Bitcoin stands out as a distinct project poised to make a significant impact upon its exchange debut. Check out our article for the $GBTC price prediction for 2024 here.
To delve deeper into the Green Bitcoin presale, watch the video provided above and follow his YouTube channel for more crypto-related videos. Additionally, Jacob Crypto Bury manages a Discord community with 21,000 members, where users can obtain trading tips and insights into upcoming crypto presales.
Green Bitcoin’s $GBTC Token Presale Success and Future Roadmap
The Green Bitcoin token presale has already amassed a substantial $2.2 million and has progressed through several phases now priced at $0.6882 per token. The presale has allocated 40% of the total $GBTC token supply, with 27.5% reserved for staking rewards.
Marketing receives 17.5%, community rewards account for 5%, and liquidity holds 10% of the supply. The project’s “Green Map” initiative aims to improve the platform’s gamified elements, enhancing the staking experience for users. Potential buyers can visit our guide on how to buy Green Bitcoin token here.

Following the presale, the team will prioritize key objectives such as implementing staking and prediction features. The overarching aim is to cultivate a community bound by eco-friendly principles, all while enabling individuals to earn passive crypto income.
Significantly, the smart contracts of Green Bitcoin recently underwent a thorough audit performed by Coinsult, a blockchain security company. Once the token is listed on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), efforts will be directed towards expanding the community and ecosystem.
With its green features and staking rewards, the $GBTC token holds significant growth potential post-presale. Further information will be disclosed in the coming weeks. We recommend following Green Bitcoin’s Telegram channel and X account (formerly Twitter) to stay updated. To take part in the $GBTC presale visit greenbitcoin.xyx.

"Optimism Price Prediction for Today, March 7 – OP Technical Analysis",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-08 00:58:42.480347,"The Optimism price prediction shows that OP is gaining more strength as the coin crosses above the moving averages.
Optimism (OP) Achieves Record High, Soars to $4.66 in Dramatic Surge
All OP token holders are currently profitable based on the current price, as indicated by data from on-chain analyst IntoTheBlock. The token’s price has surged recently, with the highest-paid price reaching 4.01% before reaching its latest milestone. This price increase corresponds with the rising popularity of L2 scaling solutions, benefiting OP token as one of the leading L2 solutions in the market.
Optimism Prediction Statistics Data:

Optimism price now – $4.35
Optimism market cap – $4.69 billion
Optimism circulating supply – 4.29 billion
Optimism total supply – 4.29 billion
Optimism Coinmarketcap ranking – #29

OP/USD Market
Key Levels:
Resistance levels: $5.50, $6.00, $6.50
Support levels: $3.00, $2.50, $2.00



  OPUSD – Daily Chart
 

OP/USD may continue to refresh to the upside as the coin currently trades at $4.35 with a bullish crossover and trend intraday. Today, the Optimism price is facing the upper boundary of the channel as higher resistance may come in the next positive direction.
Optimism Price Prediction: Optimism Price May Spike to the Upside
The Optimism price is likely to increase the bullish movement if the price increases and heads toward the upper boundary of the channel. Currently, the 9-day moving average is likely to cross above the 21-day moving average; it could send bullish signals into the market to encourage more buyers.
Meanwhile, as soon as the bulls increase the buying pressure, it is for the confirmation that the coin will head to the north, and the Optimism price could hit the nearest resistance levels at $5.50, $6.00, and $6.50 respectively. On the contrary, if the 9-day MA slides below the 21-day MA, there may be a little retreat to the south, bringing the market price to the support levels of $3.00, $2.50, and $2.00.
OP/BTC Keeps Ranging
Against Bitcoin, Optimism (OP) may cross above the 21-day moving average as the price heads to the upside. Meanwhile, the fact that the market keeps moving in the same direction within the channel, the crypto is likely to form a bullish movement if the 9-day moving average crosses above the 21-day moving average.



  OPBTC – Daily Chart
 

Nevertheless, if the buyers push the market price toward the upper boundary of the channel, crossing above this barrier could hit the resistance level of 9179 SAT and above. Meanwhile, traders should watch out for any strong selling pressure that could bring the price below the lower boundary of the channel, this could attract new sellers coming into the market with the next focus on the support level of 3800 SAT and below.
However, @AltcoinSherpa shared with his 210k followers on X (formerly Twitter) that $OP appears more favorable compared to $ARB at the moment. OP is currently experiencing a clear price discovery phase and seems to be taking the lead, with ARB expected to follow suit shortly. Nonetheless, OP is likely the stronger contender, making it the preferred choice for investment.

ETH beta: I think that $OP looks better than $ARB right now. OP in clean price discovery and looks to be leading; ARB likely to catch up soon. But OP is probably the better bet as its shown more strength pic.twitter.com/iJHT59MDG2

Alternatives to Optimism
Optimism (OP) shows signs of potential bullish momentum near its upper channel boundary, with traders anticipating a continuation of the trend. Additionally, the emergence of a new resistance level is suggested by the 9-day moving average crossing above the 21-day moving average. Despite Optimism’s established position with a market cap of $4.69 billion in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) presents an attractive investment opportunity with its substantial presale stage valuation exceeding $11.8 million, indicating promising growth potential.

Zircuit Staking Program Breaks $500M TVL And Adds Ethena Integration (7 Mar),COIN_MARKET_CAP,Chainwire,2024-03-08 00:58:45.058420,"George Town, Grand Cayman, March 7th, 2024, Chainwire

Zircuit, a zk rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level, today announced its staking program has surpassed $500M in TVL. Currently in testnet phase, Zircuit is poised to hit a mainnet TVL on day one that surpasses major blockchains such as Linea, Manta, Mantle, Near, Scroll, Aptos, and zkSync.
Next week, Zircuit will integrate Ethena, adding to its growing list of supported protocols for Zircuit Staking. Users who stake USDe with Zircuit will earn Zircuit Points and 7x Shards (Ethena points). Ethena is a crypto-native solution to a yield-bearing synthetic dollar fully collateralized and freely composable onchain. Other protocols in the program include Renzo, Kelp, Etherfi, Lido, Swell, Eigenpie, and Liquid Collective. 
Points programs have become a rising trend in crypto, offering a new way to incentivize users who contribute to a protocol. Zircuit Staking is an innovative program that allows users to deposit ETH, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) to earn Zircuit Points. Through the staking program, users can earn Zircuit points on top of any staking yield or points they are already earning. Users who opt-in to migrate their assets to the Zircuit Mainnet when it goes live are rewarded the most. Users can withdraw at any time and keep the points and yield earned, as ETH isn't hard-locked like Blast or Mantle. 
After spending over a year and a half conducting L2 research, the Zircuit team created an L2 with a built-in AI-enabled sequencer that protects users by monitoring the mempool for malicious transactions. In comparison to typical security efforts that focus on the application and smart contract levels, Zircuit brings sequencer-level security (SLS). This means that every transaction on Zircuit will go through low-level security checks resulting in a more secure chain for projects and end users. Zircuit is also fully EVM-compatible, offers greater efficiency, and provides users with cheaper and faster transactions.
Backed by Pantera Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom, Zircuit is currently in testnet phase with mainnet expected to come later in 2024. To participate in Zircuit Staking, users can visit: https://stake.zircuit.com/ 
About Zircuit
Zircuit is a zk rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level. Built by a team of web3 security veterans and PhDs in computer science, algorithms, and cryptography, Zircuit’s unique architecture combines the best of both worlds of performance and security.

Worldcoin: How will Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI impact WLD Price?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 23:58:49.403467,"Between Feb. 25 and March 7, WLD prices dipped 40% from its $9.50 all-time high after Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against Worldcoin’s parent firm.
Between bullish tailwinds from the NVIDIA-led Crypto AI renaissance and bearish headings from the legal battle between Elon Musk and OpenAI, Worldcoin price levers have been pulled in opposite directions since March 1. 
On-chain data trends provide vital insights into how initial response among crypto whales and Worldcoin long-term investors could impact WLD short-term price action. 
Worldcoin price initially dipped 40% after Elon Musk filed lawsuit
On March 1, Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against Worldcoin’s parent company, OpenAI, for breach of fiduciary duty and claims of unfair business practices. The news effectively truncated a historic February rally for the Worldcoin’s native WLD token. 



  Worldcoin (WLD) Price action before and after Elon Musk Lawsuit | February – March 7, 2024. Source: TradingView


WLD’s price soared 320% to an all-time high of $9.50 on Feb 25, which momentarily saw its market cap surpass the $1 billion mark. As news of Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI broke, it set off a panic yard sale, sending Worldcoin’s price spiraling 40% to a two-week low of $5.60 on March 5.  
It has now been a week since Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI. The two major stakeholder blocs within any cryptocurrency network are long-term holders and whale investors. On-chain indicators show that both groups have taken on a bullish disposition on Worldcoin. 
Crypto Whales continue investing in Worldcoin
With one eye on the crypto AI, rave partly triggered by NVIDIA’s record-breaking 2023 fourth-quarter earnings and growing adoption of the controversial iris scanning orbs, risk-seeking Worldcoin whales have refused to throw in the towel. 
The Santiment chart below depicts real-time changes in whale wallets holding 1 million to 10 million WLD balances. It shows that the week following Elon Musk’s lawsuit filing, the whales acquired another 720,000 WLD tokens between March 2 and March 7. 



  Worldcoin (WLD) Whales Wallet Balances Source: Santiment


Valued at the current price of $7.20 per token at press time on March 7, the newly acquired tokens are worth approximately $5.2 million. This shows that rather than exit, the whales have capitalized on the price dip to scoop up more tokens in anticipation of more significant future gains as the project develops. 
Investors with a high-risk appetite often gravitate towards distressed coins, or crypto projects embroiled in regulatory or legal contests, in hopes of a big payday if the lawsuit yields a positive outcome.
This whale cohort holds over 521.9 million WLD, representing 5.2% of Worldcoin’s 10 billion total circulation supply. On-chain buy/sell trends have historically been positively correlated to WLD price movements. If whales keep buying, WLD could avoid a dramatic price downswing as the lawsuit unfolds. 
Worldcoin long-term investors are standing firm
Furthermore, another critical on-chain indicator shows that Worldcoin long-term holders are refraining from selling their tokens amid the legal crisis. 
Santiment’s age consumed metric tracks long-term investors’ trading activity by multiplying the number of recently-traded coins by the number of days since they were last moved. 
Age-consumed figures rise when long-term investors and project insiders are on a selling spree, with many previously long-held coins on the move. 
But interestingly, the on-chain trends observed on the Worldcoin network this week show that WLD Age Consumed has been in decline since Elon Musk’s lawsuit.



  Worldcoin (WLD) Age Consumed vs. Price | Source: Santiment


Specifically, the 7.5 million coin days consumed on March 7 represents an 83% drop-off from the initial spike recorded on March 2. This metric shows that the Worldcoin long-term investors continue to show diamond hands despite the swirling controversy in the past week.  
When it occurs during a period of heightened market fear, uncertainty, and doubt it could boost other investors’ confidence. 
How will Worldcoin price react to Elon Musk’s lawsuit?
The early bullish reactions from Whales and long-term investors suggest they will likely prop up WLD prices in the near term. By continuing to HODL amid intense bearish headwinds from the legal battle between Elon Musk and OpenAI, these key stakeholders convey confidence in the long-term prospects and value of Worldcoin. 
Unsurprisingly, rather than head into a downward spiral as initially feared, WLD price has now rebounded from its weekly low of $5.60 on March 5 to reclaim $7.20 territory at press time on March 7.
This rare bullish conviction may stem from belief in the project’s fundamentals or a strategy to front-run massive gains if OpenAI experiences its own Ripple (XRP) breakout moment with a legal victory over Elon Musk.
If the current dynamics persist as the lawsuit lingers, Worldcoin price could defy the odds and enter another leg-up towards $10. ","['AI', 'HODL', 'WLD', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea308835539f471eb40964/

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a recent surge, with Bitcoin hitting a new high of $69,324 on March 5th before facing a correction. However, the greater narrative has been the outperformance of altcoins, particularly meme-themed and AI-focused projects, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. This development has sparked discussions on whether the market is entering an ‘altcoin season.’
Bitcoin’s Peak and Market Growth
Bitcoin’s sudden increase to over $69,000 briefly pushed the total value of the global cryptocurrency market beyond $2.5 trillion. Currently, the market capitalization stands at $2.52 trillion, according to the latest CoinMarketCap data.
Altcoin Market Value Surges
Altcoins have shown remarkable strength, their combined market value surpassing $1.1 trillion on the day Bitcoin reached its peak. With a 64% growth over three months, altcoins outdo Bitcoin’s 56% increase, indicating rising investor interest and the robust performance of these cryptocurrencies.
Memecoins have led the charge with significant gains, as seen with Dogecoin climbing by 20% and Shiba Inu soaring by 130%. Emerging coins like Pepe, Bonk, and dogwifhat have registered impressive double to triple-digit gains.
Artificial intelligence-related tokens such as Fetch.ai, Synesis One, SingularityNET, and Theta Network have also experienced major gains. In contrast, Bitcoin’s increase during the same timeframe was a modest 8.5%.

"Katie Stockton Says Bitcoin Will Continue to Climb, But Issued Critical Warnings",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-07 23:58:54.430699,"According to analysts, Bitcoin is heading towards new highs, but may also see harsher corrections according to the latest charts.
This week, Bitcoin fell 10% after reaching a new intraday record. However, analysts believe it could achieve further upside.
According to analysts, while Bitcoin is on track to achieve even greater rises this year, investors should consider these fluctuations as healthy retreats.
According to Fairlead Strategies, Bitcoin has been testing the last resistance level at $64,900 at the weekly close since reaching $57,000 last week. The firm is looking for two consecutive weekly closes above this level to confirm the breakout.
“A breakout would be a long-term bullish development that leaves no resistance,” said Fairlead Strategies representative Katie Stockton. Stockton added that the long-term momentum is positive and there are no signs of exhaustion in the long-term upside.
However, Bitcoin's support is at around $48,100, which represents a decline of about 30% from where BTC was trading on Thursday. Stockton suggested that there is a possibility that Bitcoin could give a sell signal next week. According to CryptoQuant, this support level is slightly higher than Bitcoin's short-term realized price of $42,700, which represents the average cost at which different BTC holders purchased their Bitcoin.
Related News: The 22 Altcoins That Users Most Want To Be Listed On Binance Futures Have Been Determined
The short-term realized price acts as a ceiling in bear markets and a floor in bull markets. JPMorgan also suggested last week that Bitcoin could drop to the $42,000 level after April, when Bitcoin-halving-induced enthusiasm fades.
CryptoQuant shows traders' unrealized profit margins are above extreme levels at 52%, a 20% increase from last week. Julio Moreno, head of research at the crypto data provider, explained that this indicator acts as a price correction signal when it rises above 40%.
Moreno cited data showing that Bitcoin is in an “overheated bull” phase, with miners in “overpayment” territory and short-term Bitcoin wallet holders starting to sell to realize higher profit margins, as evidence of the potential for further corrections.

Has Altcoin Season Begun?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 23:58:55.638270,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Has Altcoin Season Begun?
Bitcoin price experienced a sharp correction shortly after reaching an all-time high of $69,324 on March 5th. During this period, altcoin projects led by memecoins and artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies performed better than Bitcoin over the past week, sparking a debate on whether the altcoin season has arrived.
Is Altcoin Season Underway?
The brief surge of Bitcoin on March 5th, crossing $69,000, saw the global crypto market value surpass $2.5 million, reflecting the current upward momentum. According to data from CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, this figure stands at $2.52 trillion.

Altcoin projects also demonstrated similar strength, with their total market value exceeding $1.1 trillion on the same day. This data measures the total market value of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and the increasing market value day by day suggests that the altcoin season may have indeed started.

In the last three months, this value has increased by approximately 64%, rising from $697 billion on March 7th to $1.14 trillion. This is a slightly better performance than the 56% increase recorded by Bitcoin in the same period. This rise proves the growing interest of investors in altcoin projects and the impressive performance this class of crypto assets has recently shown.
Memecoin and Artificial Intelligence Trends Continue
The tremendous rally displayed by memecoins and artificial intelligence last week could be a sign that the altcoin season has begun. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that memecoin projects have seen double and triple-digit gains in the last seven days. Notably, Dogecoin rose by 20% this week, while Shiba Inu managed a 130% increase. Newer tokens like Pepe, Bonk (BONK), and dogwifhat (WIF) also achieved double to triple-digit gains during the same period.

Other notable performances came from tokens in the artificial intelligence ecosystem, led by Fetch.ai (FET), Synesis One (SNS), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Theta Network, which also saw double to triple-digit gains over seven days. Bitcoin, in the same period, rose only by 8.5%.

SEC delays spot Bitcoin ETF options request until April 4,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 23:58:56.788123,"The SEC postponed a decision on two requests to bring options on spot Bitcoin ETFs to market following the successful launch by nine issuers, excluding Grayscale’s GBTC.
According to a March 6 filing, the U.S. SEC delayed approving, denying, or initiating rule change processes for an application to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) filed by Nasdaq. 
A comment period for the proposal has already opened, and some five people have supplied feedback, asking the SEC to greenlight options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. Nasdaq filed the request in January, shortly after the securities watchdog approved Bitcoin-backed funds from issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK 21Shares. 
The SEC chose April 24 as the deadline to either approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to deny the proposed rule change.

The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. SEC filing

America’s securities regulator also deferred a decision to allow or disallow the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) from offering spot Bitcoin ETF options. Per a separate filing, this proposal has also been delayed until April 24. 
Under existing laws, Cboe can list and trade options on any exchange-traded product at least three days after the fund debuts on registered exchanges. In a Jan. 5 statement, the platform clarified that funds underpinned by digital assets like Bitcoin fall outside the purview of these rules.

"DeeStream (DST) Triumphs with Binance Coin (BNB) & Dogecoin (DOGE) Interest: Ethereum (ETH) $3,775, Shiba Inu (SHIB) 127% Surge",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 23:59:11.402869,"The surging crypto market is currently giving investors and projects many happy moments as the prices and respective returns of said projects have started to rise. But at the same time, it means that new projects must communicate their value propositions better to get investors to look their way.
A few projects that investors are keeping an eye on currently include Binance Coin (BNB),  Dogecoin (DOGE),  Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DeeStream (DST), the first decentralized streaming platform the world has seen.
Binance Coin (BNB)
Binance Coin (BNB) has its short-term holders smiling as the price has risen by 46.34% in the last month. But its long-term holders are probably not as happy as they have seen the price of Binance Coin (BNB) rise by a meager 54.06% in the last year.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Dogecoin (DOGE) price has risen by 72.36% in the last week, 112.23% in the last month, and around 121.17% in the last year. The market surge has been good for all Dogecoin (DOGE) holders.
Ethereum (ETH)
The greens on the Ethereum (ETH) chart have been rising as the price hit $3,683.71. Equivalent to a rise of 14.24% in the last seven days and 60.19% in the last month. Ethereum (ETH) long-term holders haven’t been left out, as the price has risen 134.54% in the last year.
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
For Shiba Inu (SHIB), the price has risen by 215.56% in the last week and 270.35% in the last month, courtesy of the surging market prices over the last few weeks.
DeeStream (DST)
Now let’s take a look at the projects that have investors of dozens of projects, including Binance Coin (BNB),  Dogecoin (DOGE),  Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), wondering if it’s time to diversify their portfolios, and invest their returns in its stage 1 presale.
 DeeStream (DST) is the world’s first-ever decentralized streaming platform.  They plan to take over the streaming market, which is valued at $160.55 billion as of 2024 and is expected to reach $247 billion by 2027.   DeeStream’s (DST) plan revolves around solving the issues that traditional streaming platforms like Kick and Twitch haven’t touched.
DeeStream (DST) plans to start by rewarding users for completing tasks that grow the platform. With their creators, they plan to have fewer rules around streaming and content creation and take fewer fees from them than traditional streaming platforms. They also plan to have an instant withdrawal button so creators can access funds when needed.
For its investors, DeeStream’s decentralized model means that every presale token holder gets to help decide what gets added or changed on the platform. They also get a share of platform revenue for as long as they hold the tokens.
Considering all these factors and that DeeStream (DST) has passed the audit, a presale price of $0.04 sounds too good to be true. But that’s why we think that DeeStream (DST) is a project you should check out.

Jupiter Price Shows Remarkable Growth; Will it Smash $1 Mark?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 23:59:12.740756,"
1 Jupiter (JUP) price has shown a remarkable growth of approximately 20% intraday.
2 JUP experienced a pullback and has now exceeded its previous swing high.

Jupiter’s price is surging and has shown remarkable growth in the last few trading sessions. In the recent session, the Solana-based token spiked more than 20% showing bullish dominance on the technical chart.
On a daily technical chart, Jupiter price formed a cup and handle pattern. JUP overtook the last swing high with a powerful buying candlestick of more than 20%. The price has activated a pullback after bearing support on the 20-Day moving average.
If the present running candlestick approaches the $0.700 mark and sustains, then bulls may become confident. If the technical chart structure manages to lure investors, then it may gain bullish momentum and may approach the $1 mark in a few weeks.
On the other hand, if the Jupiter crypto price fails to sustain the $0.700 mark and drops, then most of the buyers will be trapped at a high. As per the technical chart, if the JUP crypto price drops below the $0.600 level then bulls may encounter their stop losses and a sharp fall can be observed for the next few days.

Giant Asset Company Makes a Hard-to-Believe Year-End Price Prediction for Ethereum,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-07 23:59:16.252803,"Ethereum (ETH) has been “massively eclipsed” by Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months. However, this could change significantly in 2024, according to Juan Leon, a crypto research analyst at asset manager Bitwise.
Despite Bitcoin hitting all-time highs, Leon believes ETH could more than double in price this year. “Ethereum could go above $8,000, $10,000 this year, maybe even higher,” Leon said in a recent interview.
Leon noted that although Bitcoin has gained attention with the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, there are at least two important catalysts that will bring ETH into focus.
Related News: The 22 Altcoins That Users Most Want To Be Listed On Binance Futures Have Been Determined
One of these catalysts, according to the analyst, is the upcoming Dencun update, which is expected to make transactions cheaper on layer-2 networks. This could significantly increase activity on the Ethereum network and potentially attract mainstream, mass consumer demand.
“Most of the positive sentiment will occur weeks and months after the update as the effects become evident,” Leon added.
According to the Bitwise analyst, the approval likelihood for Ethereum ETFs is not as clear as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. However, the possibility of approval is expected to bring excitement to ETH. Leon estimates a 50%-60% chance of an approval, but believes approval will happen “sooner rather than later.”

Sky Mavis, the developer of the Ethereum-based GameFi project and renowned NFT game Axie Infinity, recently announced the successful implementation of a significant game update. The enhancement includes new features and functionalities, as detailed in the official blog post. In light of this update, the game’s native cryptocurrency, AXS, saw a modest increase of 3.37% in its trading price over the last day, reaching $10.74 at the time of reporting.
New Guild System Empowers Players
A key addition to Axie Infinity is the introduction of Axie Classic Guilds, as declared by the developers. This feature allows players to band together, fostering a collaborative environment where they can exchange strategies. The creation of a guild comes with an 8 AXS fee and caps membership at 60 individuals. The update also integrates AXS deposit transactions directly on the game’s platform, with a limitation of one guild creation per player.
Guild members can gift up to 6 AXS to their peers, with the potential for this limit to increase in the future. Starting March 21st, guilds will compete on a leaderboard, where they can earn points. To enhance in-game communication, a chat feature is now available for guild members.
AXS Price Trends and Technical Indicators
Technical analysis of the AXS four-hour chart illustrates a rising channel, providing investors with insights into market trends. A false breakout on March 2nd resulted in a temporary setback for investors, but current trends indicate a favorable outlook with the EMA 9 serving as a support level. The AXS chart points to key support levels of $10.51, $10.22, and $9.85, with a fall below $10.51 likely to dampen price momentum.
Conversely, resistance levels to monitor include $10.81, $11.07, and $11.42. A close above the crucial resistance of $10.81 on the four-hour bars could signal an upward momentum for the AXS price.

Core Scientific Signs Lucrative AI Deal with CoreWeave,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 23:59:18.529190,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Core Scientific Signs Lucrative AI Deal with CoreWeave
Bitcoin miner Core Scientific is working to diversify its revenue streams ahead of the upcoming halving. The company has signed a deal potentially worth over $100 million to provide data center services to the artificial intelligence initiative CoreWeave. Core Scientific announced it will lease a tier 3 data center in Texas, which previously hosted Hewlett Packard, to accommodate CoreWeave’s infrastructure.
Mining Company Takes Significant Step
According to the terms of the contract, the miner will offer up to 16 MW of capacity at its new data center in Austin and will expand its business to include high-performance computing (HPC). CoreWeave is an artificial intelligence cloud computing company backed by major Wall Street financial firms such as Jane Street, JP Morgan Asset Management, and Fidelity. The venture provides infrastructure for compute-intensive use cases like machine learning. As of December 2023, the company was valued at $7 billion. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan commented:

“Our new data center in Austin will support CoreWeave’s short-term needs and will also expand and diversify Core Scientific’s hosting customer portfolio in two high-value computing categories: Bitcoin mining and a specialized GPU cloud computing system.”

Core Scientific and the Halving Process
Core Scientific’s expansion of its service offerings comes just weeks before the Bitcoin halving event, which will cut Bitcoin block reward income in half. The 2024 Bitcoin halving event, following previous events in 2020, 2016, and 2012, will see miners’ block rewards drop from the current 6.25 Bitcoins per block to 3.125 Bitcoins. The purpose of the halving event is to control Bitcoin’s inflation and reduce the supply of new tokens over time.
While miners will see a significant decrease in revenue, the costs associated with operations are likely to increase. According to an analysis by CoinShares, the electricity costs per Bitcoin before and after the halving represent approximately 68% and 71% of miners’ total cost structure, respectively. The average production cost for crypto miners after the halving is projected to be $37,856.

Core Scientific, after mining 19,274 Bitcoins valued at $812 million in 2023, became the largest publicly traded crypto mining company in North America. Following a 13-month restructuring process to resolve $400 million in debt caused by falling Bitcoin prices, rising energy costs, and debts related to the bankrupt Celsius Network, the miner recently emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the United States.

Bitcoin mining giant Core Scientific has revealed a strategic alliance with CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence cloud computing, in a move to diversify its revenue ahead of the anticipated Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific will repurpose a former Hewlett Packard tier 3 data center in Texas to meet the infrastructure needs of CoreWeave. The deal promises to yield more than $100 million for Core Scientific.
Expansion into High-Performance Computing
Under the agreement, Core Scientific will allocate up to 16 MW of power at its new Austin facility to CoreWeave. The collaboration marks Core Scientific’s entry into the high-performance computing sector. CoreWeave, with a $7 billion valuation as of December 2023, is backed by recognized financial entities including Jane Street, JP Morgan Asset Management, and Fidelity. Core Scientific’s CEO highlighted the dual focus of the new data center in supporting both Bitcoin mining and specialized GPU cloud computing.
Strategic Shift Prior to Bitcoin Halving
This strategic expansion surfaces as the Bitcoin ecosystem braces for the halving event, which will slash block reward income by 50%, reducing miners’ earnings. The upcoming halving, scheduled for 2024, follows previous cycles in 2020, 2016, and 2012, and aims to curb inflation by decreasing the rate of new Bitcoin issuance.
The halving is expected to drive up operational costs for miners, with electricity expenses already constituting a significant part of the cost structure, as per CoinShares analysis. Post-halving projections indicate an average production cost of $37,856 per Bitcoin for miners.
Core Scientific, which mined 19,274 Bitcoins valued at $812 million in 2023, stands as North America’s most prominent publicly traded crypto mining firm. The company has recently emerged from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, orchestrated to manage its $400 million debt, which was attributed to declining Bitcoin prices, surging energy costs, and financial ties with the defunct Celsius Network.

"Unlikely Bitcoin will Match Gold in Portfolios, Predicts JPMorgan",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 23:59:21.149142,"Key Points

JPMorgan analysts suggest it’s unrealistic for Bitcoin to match gold in investors’ portfolios based on notional amounts.
Despite significant inflows into new Bitcoin ETFs, the volatility of Bitcoin compared to gold makes equal allocation unlikely.

JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have recently stated that it would be impractical to expect Bitcoin to equal gold in terms of notional amounts in investors’ portfolios. This comes in spite of the substantial inflows into newly established spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.
Considering Risk and Volatility
The analysts highlighted that the risk factor is frequently overlooked in the debate advocating for Bitcoin to match gold within investment portfolios. They pointed out that Bitcoin’s market capitalization would need to escalate to $3.3 trillion, the value of gold held for investment purposes, which would mean more than a doubling of the current Bitcoin price.
The team emphasized that most investors take into account risk and volatility when distributing across asset classes. Given that the volatility of Bitcoin is approximately 3.7 times higher than that of gold, they concluded that it’s unrealistic to expect Bitcoin to match gold in notional amounts within investors’ portfolios.
Realistic Expectations for Bitcoin
If Bitcoin were to match gold in terms of risk capital (the funds allocated for speculative activities), the implied allocation would decrease to $0.9 trillion. This figure is derived by dividing $3.3 trillion by 3.7, suggesting a Bitcoin price of $45,000, significantly lower than current levels.
The analysts anticipate that spot Bitcoin ETFs could see around $62 billion worth of inflows within the next 2-3 years. They noted that this is a “realistic target” for the potential size of spot Bitcoin ETFs over time.
However, they expressed doubt that the entire $9 billion represents new money entering the crypto space, suggesting that retail investors are likely shifting from existing instruments and venues to new spot Bitcoin ETFs.","['BTC', 'KAU', 'GOLD', 'GOLD', 'GOLD']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea261c35539f471eb40954/

SOL anticipates surge with upcoming retail launch of GFOX,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 23:59:23.576236,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.
Two projects, Solana and Galaxy Fox, are drawing attention to their potential gains. Solana, known for challenging Ethereum’s supremacy, and Galaxy Fox, a newcomer blending meme culture with blockchain gaming, are on the brink of exciting developments.
Solana’s position strengthened amid market volatility
Solana has been making waves as a viable alternative to Ethereum because of its low transaction fees and scalability.
The recent market pullbacks haven’t deterred $SOL’s upward trajectory, showcasing a solid bullish trend of higher lows and higher highs. This technical setup, coupled with favorably aligned moving averages, signals sustained buying interest and reinforces a bullish sentiment.
Analyzing $SOL’s price chart reveals critical levels to watch. Immediate resistance around $135 presents a crucial hurdle to overcome for a potential rally to unfold.

Conversely, support near $115 and $104 has historically acted as launchpads for price rebounds, indicating $SOL’s resilience in market fluctuations.
Notably, robust volume accompanying recent price movements underscores active market participation, setting the stage for a potential bullish breakout.
Amid Ethereum’s ongoing challenges with high gas fees and network congestion, Solana emerges as an attractive alternative.
With its scalability and low-cost transactions, $SOL could garner significant attention from developers and investors seeking not only a good crypto to buy but also refuge from Ethereum’s limitations.
As market sentiment shifts towards seeking alternatives, $SOL stands poised to capitalize on this demand, potentially fueling a surge in its price.

K33Research Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde has seen a sharp increase in website traffic for cryptocurrency exchanges. Thus, 90-day website traffic increased by 45% from August to October.

During that period, the total volume of traffic on crypto exchanges was 550 million, and from December 2023 to February 2024, this figure increased by 45% and amounted to 801 million.
However, the latest values are still below the maximum of the last two years, as the most significant traffic volume was recorded from June to August 2022 at 910 million. During this period, the beginning of a bear market was noted, as well as the collapse of several large cryptocurrency companies.

The latest data shows that “retail is gradually returning to the market,” Lunde points out. The jump is likely due to the recovery of the cryptocurrency market, which began in late 2023 with the rise in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and the anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
In addition, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have experienced significant growth. The traffic volume was 311 million from August to October 2023, and from December 2023 to February 2024, it increased by 66% to 519 million.

“Still, both are well behind the summer of 2022.”  Vetle Lunde, K33Research senior analyst

On March 5, BTC updated its historical maximum – the rate exceeded $69,000. Over the past month, Bitcoin has risen in price by about 60%, and its capitalization has surpassed $1.34 trillion, a record figure.
The demand for Bitcoin and the sharp rise in its price are primarily explained by the significant influx of capital into the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January. Another growth factor is the halving, which is expected in April.

Sensei and Professor Astrones, notable crypto analysts, anticipate a significant bull run for FET.
Sensei, a top crypto analyst, tweeted that FET is “programmed” to reach “double digits” by the end of the month. Furthermore, he added that the “real question is where FET will stop” given the booming artificial intelligence sector. Sensei forecasted that FET could potentially “touch 25-30 or 40$[sic]” in what would be Fetch’s biggest rally.
Besides, Professor Astrones, another top crypto analyst, concurred with Sensei’s bullish outlook. In a tweet, ProfessorAstrones estimated that FET’s top price in this cycle would be between $20-$30. He stated “Just zoom out and see that we only started”, hinting that such lofty targets were reachable considering FET’s multi-year trajectory. Professor Astrones, expressing enthusiasm, eagerly anticipates FET’s projected parabolic rise, stating, “What a time to be alive.”
Current Fetch.ai Price and Market Behavior
At the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap revealed that FET was trading at $2.57, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $1.35 billion. Moreover, this marks a significant 26.14% increase from its price in the last 24 hours alone. This surge of buying pressure has pushed FET up the market cap rankings, reflecting growing appetite for the project amongst investors.

Ethereum-based GameFi project leader and popular NFT-based game Axie Infinity has successfully completed its game update. The update details for the game developed by Sky Mavis were shared with the public through the official blog page. Despite notable developments, the project’s native token AXS was trading at $10.74, up 3.37% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.
Axie Team Announces Guild Integration
Axie team announced in a blog post that Axie Classic Guilds are now part of the game. With this update, players can join a guild, allowing them to share strategies among themselves. The fee to create a guild has been set at 8 AXS by the team, and a guild can have a total of 60 members. With this step, users can now perform AXS deposit transactions through the game’s website, and a player can create only one guild.
Within the guild, each player can send up to 6 AXS to other members, but the team shared in the blog post that this amount might increase in the future. A leaderboard for guilds will be considered starting from March 21st, and each guild will be able to accumulate points. Along with all these developments, a chat feature has been added to the game to enable guild members to communicate with each other.

AXS Chart Analysis
The four-hour AXS chart shows a rising channel that offers important clues to investors. The resistance break on March 2nd turned out to be a bull trap, leading to losses for investors. The recent formations where the EMA 9 (blue line) acts as support suggest a bullish scenario gaining traction.
The most important support levels to watch on the AXS chart are, in order; $10.51, $10.22, and $9.85. Closures of four-hour bars below the $10.51 level, which intersects with the EMA 9, will cause the AXS price to lose momentum.
The most important resistance levels to watch on the AXS chart are, in order; $10.81, $11.07, and $11.42. Especially, the closure of four-hour bars above the significant resistance level of $10.81 will help the AXS price to gain momentum.

Popular Altcoin Organization Commences Massive Token Sale,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 23:59:28.650141,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Popular Altcoin Organization Commences Massive Token Sale
A notable altcoin’s managing foundation listed on the Binance exchange is poised to divest a substantial amount of its tokens, amounting to 19.5 million units. This sale comes at a time when Ethereum‘s layer2 solutions are garnering increasing attention and are expected to continue their upward price trajectory. Despite the anticipation of enhanced interest in these solutions, the OP Token stands out with its upcoming massive sales event.
Market Impact of Token Sale
Currently, the market has not significantly reacted to this news. The involved team intends to offload tokens with a market value of $87 million. This move aligns with a trend where foundations orchestrate large-scale token unlocks, sparking caution among investors. Nevertheless, given the bullish market conditions and robust demand for layer2 solutions, a substantial price drop remains uncertain.
The OP Token faces yet another release event in 21 days, with $110 million worth of tokens or 2.4% of its circulating supply hitting the market by month’s end. It’s essential to consider high inflation rates when evaluating such tokens, as their long-term value should reflect periodic supply increases.
Projections estimate that the altcoin’s circulating supply will reach approximately 3 billion by year’s end. To sustain its current price, the market capitalization would have to rise to $13.5 billion. However, the current valuation stands at a more modest $4.6 billion.
Optimism Foundation Sheds Light on the Sale
The Optimism Foundation recently clarified that the tokens slated for sale are sourced from its unallocated treasury. The tokens sold will be locked for two years, though they may be transferred for governance purposes. This sale, part of the foundation’s initial operating budget, represents 30% of the initial OP token supply. The foundation assures that the forthcoming transactions are planned, aiming to maintain transparency with the community. The details of the sale, including the buyer and specific terms, remain private.

 Observers of the cryptocurrency industry, who were recently attentive to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have turned their eyes towards the developments of Ethereum ETF applications. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its verdict on an Ethereum ETF proposal from Franklin Templeton, a notable investment firm. This has created a temporary standstill in the progression of Ethereum’s ETF availability. 
Ethereum’s ETF Journey Hits Regulatory Roadblock
 The SEC, which previously greenlit Bitcoin ETFs, is currently reviewing several Ethereum ETF submissions. However, the regulatory institution has opted to defer its decision on Franklin Templeton’s ETF offering. Despite this delay, market experts are actively discussing the situation, noting that Ethereum’s price has experienced an uptick linked to the anticipation of ETF approvals. 
Market Reactions and Future Expectations
 Analysts believe that the SEC is likely to authorize Ethereum-centric ETFs in due course, following the Bitcoin ETF precedent. However, they acknowledge the SEC’s legal prerogative to postpone or extend its decision-making timeframe, which it is currently utilizing. Amidst this regulatory suspense, Ethereum’s market value reflects resilience, with a 1.4% increase over the past day, trading at $3,874 at the time of reporting.

 Bitcoin‘s momentum is evident as its value soared to $67,700, paralleled by the BlackRock ETF’s staggering $900 million volume within hours. The surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs’ volumes in March shattered previous records, soaring past $10 billion and hinting at the cryptocurrency’s journey to unprecedented heights. 
Investors Flock to Bitcoin in Droves
 Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges saw a peak in daily spot Bitcoin trading volume, reaching $46.26 billion on March 5th, the highest in a year. This surge points towards the influx of individual investors, a hallmark of a bull market upswing. Bitwise analyst Mallika Kollar noted an approximately 680% increase in spot trading volume since the year’s start, indicating robust buying activity. 
 The remarkable trading volume follows substantial inflows through ETFs, reflecting investor enthusiasm, particularly those versed in traditional finance, for the cryptocurrency sector. 
Global Cryptocurrency Demand Signals Strong Market Phase
 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed the correlation between the rising volumes and Bitcoin’s price. The burgeoning interest from Asian markets, coupled with the United States’ ETF involvement, heralds the onset of a potent global market phase. The Korean Premium Index’s significant rise from February suggests sustained and above-average demand from South Korean investors. 
 Data from Coinglass shows that over 35 million addresses now hold at least $10 worth of Bitcoin as of March 6th, corroborating the growth in individual investor attention. Google trend data also illustrates an 80% rise, marking a 31% year-over-year increase in interest. 
 The current trends imply that the burgeoning interest in cryptocurrencies may set the stage for larger Bitcoin peaks akin to prior bull markets. Nonetheless, potential corrections, common even in robust market periods, could lead to substantial sell-offs in alternative coins, prompting investors to remain vigilant with their stop-loss strategies.

Binance exchange-listed popular altcoin’s managing foundation will sell 19.5 million tokens. In the coming days, Ethereum layer2 solutions were expected to gain more interest and see price increases. However, it seems that OP Token will be an exception.
Will OP Coin Decline?
At the time of writing, the price has not shown much concern for this development, but the team announced it will sell 19.5 million tokens valued at $87 million (current market price). For investors weary of massive unlock events, this has become the norm.
On the other hand, looking at the brighter side, we are in a bull market and the demand for layer2 solutions is lively, with expectations for this trend to continue with Dencun. From this perspective, it’s possible that there won’t be a significant negative impact on the price.
OP Token has another unlock event worth $110 million in 21 days. 2.4% of the circulating supply will enter the market before the month ends. Tokens with high inflation rates should be periodically divided by their supply targets and priced accordingly in the long term.

For example, by the end of this year, the circulating supply will be approximately 3 billion, which means, to maintain the current unit price, the market value should be $13.5 billion (3*4.5). So, what is the market value now? At the time of writing, it stands at $4.6 billion.
Announcement from the Optimism Foundation
A few hours ago, the foundation announced that these tokens would come from the unallocated treasury. The full statement is as follows;

“Optimism has conducted a private sale of approximately 19.5 million OP tokens. The tokens are subject to a two-year lock-up period. During the lock-up, the buyer can transfer the tokens to independent third parties for governance participation.
The tokens come from the Unallocated portion of the OP Token treasury and are part of the original operating budget, which constitutes 30% of the Foundation’s initial OP token supply. You will see transfers in the next few days. All these are planned transactions, and we are sharing an alert to inform the community. Since this is a private sale, terms and the buyer are not disclosed.”

Solana (SOL) nears a major peak, signifying market recovery and investor interest. Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) launches, offering new profit avenues post-successful presale.
Solana (SOL) is approaching a milestone last achieved in March 2022, highlighting its broad acceptance in the cryptocurrency world.
As the market experiences a revival, especially among leading altcoins, investors are diversifying their portfolios, with Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) emerging as a promising option. After a successful presale, this meme coin is poised for its market debut.

Solana solidifies its position within top cryptocurrencies
Solana was one of the first projects regarded as an ‘Ethereum killer’ when it launched in 2020. The blockchain is technically superior to its counterpart and many other top crypto coins.
Solana is lauded for boasting super-fast and ultra-cheap transactions, making it one of the go-to platforms for smart contracts and decentralized apps. Recently, the network exceeded $5 billion in all-time volume for NFTs it minted. 
Considering that the NFT market is slowly growing after a few years in decline, Solana has already been responsible for several viral meme tokens like BONK and Dogwifhat. Hence, this proves the platform is versatile.
Aside from competition, a major downside for Solana is its outages over the years, raising questions about the blockchain’s stability. While the situation has improved, the developers have yet to resolve the issue.
Still, SOL continues to make high after high. SOL is up 75% from a yearly low of $79 to a yearly high of $138. In the long term, SOL has surged 1,625% since the start of 2023, when it traded for $8. Moreover, estimates imply SOL can be worth at least $200 before 2025.

Following its presale, the project is laying the groundwork for an official launch on March 4, 2024. It promises a blend of entertainment and activism, encouraging community involvement through events and a Meme Hall of Fame.
Early adopters of $RBLZ are rewarded with benefits like governance rights and exclusive updates. The token, now listed on exchanges, is expected to rise beyond its presale success.
The developers have already listed $RBLZ for $0.025 on the Uniswap and Coinstore exchanges. It is predicted to begin rising further than the 150% climb it achieved in the presale when it traded for $0.010.

Over the past year, Bitcoin's value has surged by an impressive 204%, indicating a robust bullish trend. 
Bitcoin's V-shaped recovery 
Bitcoin recently underwent a V-shaped recovery, bouncing back swiftly from a sharp decline that accompanied a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. 
This recovery led to a consolidation phase, where the price stabilized in a specific range before preparing for another potential upswing.

This remarkable achievement arrived just a day following Bitcoin's surge past its all-time high, underlining the significant rewards miners can reap amidst favorable market conditions, according to Cryptopotato.
According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, this milestone was narrowly outpaced only by April 14, 2021, when miners earned a record $77.3 million in a single day, amidst a more than 20% market correction. Interestingly, the recent revenue spike comes as Bitcoin recently soared beyond $69,000, later experiencing a notable retracement.
Despite Bitcoin's price adjustment to around $67,000, inflows into US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued robustly. This suggests that ETF investors remain confident, seizing the opportunity to invest amid the price dip. Moreover, Bitcoin's network hash rate remains near its peak of 650 Eh/sec, while mining difficulty saw a slight decrease of 3% this month, positioning the current difficulty level at 79.35 T.
Bitcoin mining stocks have recently diverged from spot BTC prices, a phenomenon Blockware Solutions attributes to investor caution ahead of the 2024 halving event. Historical patterns suggest that such disparities could present lucrative opportunities for acquiring mining stocks at a discount, considering their significant appreciation over the past 15 months.
This surge in mining revenue and the strategic positioning of investors ahead of the halving underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues its journey through various cycles, the mining sector remains a critical component of the ecosystem, navigating through challenges and capitalizing on opportunities presented by market fluctuations.","['BTC', 'ETF', 'APRIL', 'WHEN', 'DAILY']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea227a35539f471eb4094f/

Experts and analysts continue to comment on the process, which has recently had a positive impact on Ethereum prices.
According to analyst comments, the SEC is expected to approve Ethereum-related applications following the Bitcoin ETF process, but the regulatory authority has many legal rights to delay or extend the process, which it continues to exercise.

Nothing like that is remotely close to happening anytime soon.”

Despite the Federal Reserve’s exploration of CBDCs and a report released last year on their implications, Powell confirmed that the Fed would not issue a CBDC without congressional approval. This was highlighted during a query from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., which Powell responded to affirmatively.
The discussion around CBDCs has also led to legislative actions, including a bill signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis banning federal CBDC use in Florida and a bill advanced by Republicans in the House Financial Services Committee to prohibit the Fed from issuing a CBDC directly to individuals.

"Pantera in Fundraising Efforts To Finance Purchase of Solana (SOL) Valued at $250,000,000 From FTX: Report",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 22:59:39.433909,"
Crypto asset manager Pantera Capital is reportedly raising funds to finance a nine-figure purchase of smart contract platform Solana (SOL) from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, Pantera is seeking funds to buy $250 million worth of the Ethereum (ETH) rival from the failed digital asset exchange.
  

The report cites marketing materials sent to prospective investors in February, which stipulated that in return for the ability to purchase SOL at 39% of the value of its 30-day average price, investors would have to agree to hold the digital asset for at least four years.
Solana is trading for $147 at time of writing, a 14.2% increase during the last 24 hours and a staggering increase of over 600% during the last year.
Those who wish to participate would have to put in at least $25 million worth of funding, according to the report.
Pantera originally planned on having the funds by the end of February. However, an anonymous person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg that they weren’t able to meet their goal but they did raise an undisclosed amount.
In December, blockchain tracker Lookonchain found that $90 million worth of Solana potentially related to FTX had been unstaked and transferred to top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase.
In September, court documents revealed that FTX – which went bankrupt in November 2022 after its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was accused of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds – held over $1.16 billion worth of Solana at the time.
Bankman-Fried was found guilty last year and is currently awaiting to be sentenced.

Simplifying Crypto Swaps & Bridges: Introducing Xion Finance V2 - Dark Edition!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,XionFinance,2024-03-07 22:59:40.617717,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Xion Finance stands out as a beacon of simplicity and accessibility.

Let’s delve into the specifics of the current stablecoin landscape and why the team at Xion Finance sees this as a ripe opportunity for innovation.Understanding the Stablecoin MarketStablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering users a reliable and relatively stable means of transacting value. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are pegged to real-world assets like fiat currencies or commodities, providing stability in an otherwise turbulent market. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) are among the most widely used stablecoins, facilitating billions of dollars in daily transactions.The Need for Seamless Payments and SettlementsDespite the growing popularity of stablecoins, the process of acquiring, transacting, and cashing out can still be cumbersome and costly. Traditional on-ramps and off-ramps often involve high fees, lengthy processing times, and complex procedures, limiting the accessibility of stablecoin transactions, especially for newcomers to the crypto space. Xion Finance recognizes these pain points and sees an opportunity to streamline the entire process, making the process of getting into and out of stablecoins, effortless and accessible to a wider audience.Xion Finance’s Approach to Simplifying Crypto TransactionsWith the V2 Dark Edition, Xion aims to make crypto swaps as easy as 1 without the 2, 3.

"Solana (SOL) tops $150 amid Pantera Capital bid, surge in memecoin and DApp activity",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 22:59:41.806676,"Solana’s native (SOL) token surged by 19.5% between March 5 and March 7, reaching $150 for the first time since January 2022. The increase gained momentum after Bloomberg reported Pantera Capital's asset manager's plans to purchase $250 million worth of SOL tokens from the bankrupt FTX estate. Traders are now questioning whether SOL can sustain its 47% gains over twelve days and the likelihood of the altcoin surpassing $200.
Solana DEXs activity surges as memecoins rally
Regardless of whether Pantera Capital's proposal is accepted, it represents only a fraction of the $5.9 billion held in SOL tokens by the FTX estate, accounting for nearly 10% of the supply. Therefore, the bullish momentum likely stems from other factors, such as the frenzy surrounding Solana SPL memecoins. For example, on March 6, a collection of tokens inspired by celebrities and poorly drawn tokens like Jeo Boden, Juses crust, and Spooderman, dominated in terms of volume and performance.
Even for those who see no value in the trend, it encourages investors to speculate on newly launched tokens within the Solana network and prompts developers to provide liquidity for their projects. Essentially, the momentary hype positively influences the demand for SOL tokens and the utilization of its decentralized exchanges (DEX) ecosystem. By attracting attention, particularly from newcomers, the Solana network solidifies its appeal to traders who may be less concerned about decentralization and perhaps even lower fees on competing blockchains.
Furthermore, other SPL tokens with functional use or associated applications, such as Jupiter (JUP) and Raydium (RAY), surged by nearly 30% between March 5 and March 7. In addition to the DEX sector, Jito (JTO) rose by 15.5%, and Helium Mobile (MOBILE) traded up by 14.5% during the same period. Additionally, there is anticipation surrounding airdrops, including Wormhole, Kamino, Parcl, and MarginFi, which creates ongoing demand for SOL tokens.
SOL’smomentum largely depends on Solana network activity
One might argue that SOL's bullish momentum could wane after the airdrop and memecoin hype, or speculate that the FTX bankruptcy estate might further restrict the price upside. However, none of these criticisms hold much weight if volumes continue to surge. Essentially, SOL's performance isn't solely reliant on specific SPL token performances as long as new protocols and use cases continue to emerge.

Post by user @0xGumshoe on X social network. Source: X.com


As observed by Gumshoe, current Solana DEX activity far surpasses the peak prior to the FTX-Alameda Research collapse in November 2022. Therefore, rather than fixating on token performance, it's more prudent to monitor whether the Solana network is expanding in terms of deposits and volumes. After all, SOL's demand hinges on its ecosystem, which may have been positively influenced by memecoins, liquid staking, and airdrops, but it isn't limited to them.
The Solana network's smart contract deposits, gauged by the total value locked (TVL), reached a 16-month high on March 6 at 22.8 million SOL, signifying a 33% increase from the previous month. Notably, competitor BNB Chain's TVL increased by 2.5% in BNB terms, while Arbitrum decreased by 18% in ETH (ETH) terms during the same period. The surge in deposits for Solana’s decentralized applications (DApps) stemmed from increases in Jito, MarginFi, Kamino, BlazeStake, Jupiter, and Drift.

On a comparative scale, Solana DApps volume surged by 311% in the preceding 30 days, whereas the Ethereum network experienced a 7% decline. No other top-10 competitor managed to match Solana's growth.
However, in absolute terms, there remains a substantial gap compared to Arbitrum's $31.1 billion and BNB Chain's $25.2 billion monthly volumes. Ultimately, whether SOL reclaims the $200 level will hinge on the continued increase in demand for the Solana network, but it undeniably operates within a competitive industry.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Options Data Points To This Level By The End Of March, Data Says",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-07 22:59:42.992440,"According to one analyst, Bitcoin (BTC) options are bullish based on strike position and put-call ratios for March month-end expiration.
Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner said that since Bitcoin hit its all-time high, the most traded products by volume have been monthly and mid-month expiration call options with a $70,000 call price.
This concentration of call options at a $70,000 strike price on Deribit, the world's largest Bitcoin options platform, is seen in both weekend Friday and month-end expiration transactions in March.
Kooner suggests that the current put-call ratio of Bitcoin options has traders bullish. Kooner said, “The put-call (put-call) rate has remained continuously below 0.6 for the first time in 6 months, and the 24-hour put-call rate presents an even more bullish outlook with 0.47.” said.
Related News: BREAKING: DWF Labs Announces Investment in a New Altcoin
Bitfinex head of derivatives noted that implied volatility in the options market has decreased recently, pointing to lower volatility expectations among traders over the past 24 hours. As a result, the premium paid for options fell across all strike prices, making position taking costs cheaper. Deribit's implied volatility index for Bitcoin dropped from 77% to 72% in the last 24 hours.
Kooner continued his words as follows:

“Decreasing implied volatility values generally lead to a decrease in option premiums because the expectation of a lack of volatility in the future compared to the past provides lower risk for options market participants.”

Bitcoin’s Surge in Value and Market Activity,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 22:59:44.217514,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Bitcoin’s Surge in Value and Market Activity
As this article was prepared, BTC climbed to $67,700 and the BlackRock ETF reached a volume of $900 million in just 3 hours. In March, the volumes of spot Bitcoin ETFs significantly increased, setting a new record of over $10 billion. The rapid increase in demand has enabled Bitcoin‘s price to embark on a journey to all-time highs.
Why Is Bitcoin Rising?
The cumulative spot Bitcoin trading volume on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges reached $46.26 billion on March 5th, marking the highest level in the last year. Moreover, this data confirms that the influx of individual investors, typical of bull markets, may have started. Bitwise analyst Mallika Kollar wrote on her social media account;

“People are buying Bitcoin, and spot trading volume has increased by almost 680% since the beginning of the year.”


The record trading volume since the beginning of the year follows massive inflows seen through ETF channels. The volume exceeding $10 billion reflects the excitement of investors familiar with traditional finance towards cryptocurrencies.
The Future of Cryptocurrencies
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the strong rise concurrent with the increase in volume. Moreover, with growing interest from Asian markets and the United States joining the game through ETF channels, it signals the start of the strongest phase of the global rise. As you may recall, excessive demand had been coming from Asia for a long time and was the trigger for last year’s surges.
Today, demand in Asia remains strong. How do we know this? Of course, from the Korean Premium Index, which has been rising significantly since the beginning of February, indicating that demand from South Korean investors is above the global average.
According to Coinglass data, the number of addresses holding at least $10 worth of Bitcoin exceeded 35 million on March 6th, further confirming the increase in individual investor interest. Google trend data also rose above 80, confirming a 31% increase in interest compared to a year ago.

The current outlook suggests that the strong interest in cryptocurrencies could trigger larger BTC peaks similar to previous bull markets. However, even during bull seasons, BTC corrections of up to 30% are not surprising. Currently, such a correction could trigger massive sell-offs in altcoins, so investors should carefully set their stop regions.

"Chainlink News: POR Tech, Partnership With SocialScan And More",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 22:59:45.367264,"Chainlink has developed a “Proof of Reserve” Technology and has made a strategic partnership with Social Scan.
Consider a logistics company that uses a blockchain to track their shipments but cannot communicate with the one they use to make payments. This could cause many issues. The problem is that each blockchain is a separate entity. The need to rely on a source outside the blockchain to provide accurate information has always been a weak point when it comes to obtaining and supplying information to the outside world. So, what is the solution?
How Chainlink Solves The Verification Problem
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enhances smart contract capabilities by providing reliable data from various sources. Chainlink then provides a single, validated data point to the smart contract, reducing the risk of a centralized point of failure.
Chainlink’s use cases include accessing interest rates and pricing assets by decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to automating contract settlements. Additionally, insurance companies can use Chainlink to settle crop contracts based on parameters such as the quantity of temperature rainfall. You can read about other Oracle applications here.
Proof of Reserve Technology for Chainlink
As for Chainlink, the leading project in decentralized oracle innovations, progress does not stop and continues at a rapid pace. A few days ago, the protocol team announced the implementation of the “Proof of Reserve” technology for the exchange-traded fund issuer Ark Invest.
Chainlink will be responsible for verifying the Ark Investment fund’s reserves in real-time, which, by providing spot exposure to its investors on the Bitcoin market, must ensure a 1:1 collateralization with the underlying asset.
This is just the beginning of all the progress made by Chainlink last year, with the project becoming the undisputed leader in the tokenization of real assets, thanks to the support of the Swift network.
In recent developments, Chainlink (LINK) solidified partnerships to enhance transparency and functionality within the crypto space. One partnership involves 21Shares, a cryptocurrency ETF issuer, which has integrated Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve technology to ensure transparency for both on-chain and off-chain assets.
Chainlink’s strategic alliance with SocialScan
Additionally, Chainlink Labs has formed a strategic alliance with SocialScan, a platform that specializes in community-owned LLMs (Linked Learning Modules) designed to facilitate navigation within the blockchain ecosystem. 
This collaboration aims to support Chainlink SCALE members by developing essential tools such as block explorers, enabling easier access to on-chain data and AI.
SocialScan offers preferential pricing to SCALE members, providing discounted rates and reduced integration costs. These developments coincide with the surge in Chainlink’s token price.
The token is showing positive performance compared to its sale price. It is trading near its cycle high. LINK’s recent rebound from a significant resistance level and the formation of an uptrend pattern suggests that the upward trend could continue.
Summary
The protocol team announced “Proof of Reserve” implementation for Ark Invest’s ETFs linked to the crypto market. Chainlink will verify the fund’s reserves in real-time. Additionally, Chainlink Labs formed an alliance with SocialScan to support Chainlink SCALE members by developing essential tools such as block explorers for easier access to on-chain data and AI.

Ripple Bull Flag and $2.5 Trillion Pump Gears XRP and CTF for Massive Rally: Here Are Analysts’ Targets,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 22:59:47.933933,"Crypto enthusiasts and analysts are abuzz with excitement as a bullish pattern takes shape for XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple’s payment protocol. According to a post by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a bull flag formation has officially emerged, prompting analysts to predict a staggering 1549% price surge for XRP.
A Bull Flag Formation and Its Implications
JackTheRippler shared the news on social media, exclaiming, “Bull Flag officially forms with some analysts predicting a pump of nearly 1549% incoming! Are you ready for $12.45 per #XRP?” The potential rally, if realized, could catapult XRP’s price to unprecedented heights, igniting a frenzy of activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
The Rise of CTF Token and Its Potential
Amidst the XRP frenzy, JackTheRippler also highlighted the prospects of CTF token, the purported “only #defi token on XRPL.” Despite a recent 15% pump, CTF token currently trades at a mere $0.35. However, JackTheRippler painted a tantalizing picture, suggesting that if CTF token shared XRP’s market cap, its price could skyrocket from $0.35 to a staggering $1498.
JackTheRippler emphasized the token’s scarcity, noting its total supply of only 120 million tokens, which could potentially exacerbate a “supply shock” and drive prices even higher. “No one is paying attention except institutions!” they declared, calling CTF token a “gold mine” and providing trading links and the project’s website.

$2.5 Trillion Influx and Forbes’ Bold Prediction
In a separate post, JackTheRippler cited a report from Forbes, predicting that XRP could soar to $54.87 based on the influx of $2.5 trillion into XRP and Ethereum. This colossal sum, the post claimed, would be channeled through the XRPL as decentralized finance (DeFi) gains traction.
With DeFi’s ascent, JackTheRippler reiterated the potential for CTF token, asserting, “There top #defi token on XRPL is @TokenCTF and it’s literally sitting at $0.25, with only $30 million market cap (not even trillions) CTF would pump to $1437!”



The Potential Windfall for CTF Token Investors
JackTheRippler’s projections painted a picture of immense wealth creation for those holding CTF token, emphasizing, “Can you imagine! That’s literally $4500 for every dollar worth of CTF right now!” The post urged readers to “pack their bags,” as “XRPL defi is where the money is at and only institutions are paying attention!”
As the crypto community eagerly awaits the potential bull run, speculation and anticipation surrounding XRP and CTF token continue to mount, fueled by the allure of life-changing returns and the promise of a DeFi revolution on the XRPL.

Bitcoin: The prophecy has been fulfilled!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 22:59:49.103028,"Bitcoin (BTC) needs no introduction. It particularly attracts attention as it is the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. But Bitcoin is also a revolutionary asset that has changed our perception and also our relationship with money. Today, it is increasingly accepted that currency can not only be fiduciary and material but also digital and virtual, thanks to the emergence of Bitcoin in 2008. However, the almost miraculous appearance of Bitcoin was not an accident. Three visionaries, namely Milton Friedman, Friedrich A. Hayek, and Henry Ford, had predicted it. This article looks back at these prophets who foretold what some like to call “digital gold.”
Milton Friedman and His Revolutionary Monetary Ideas
One paradoxical thing about prophecies is that when they are made, they are met with disbelief by the prophet’s contemporaries. One can imagine that the famous economist Milton Friedman faced such pushback for his revolutionary ideas, especially regarding the flagship crypto, Bitcoin. Although he is not directly named among the creators of this digital currency, he is undoubtedly one of the thinkers who discussed its appearance. Years before the revolutionary emergence of Bitcoin, Milton Friedman had already envisioned the rise of digital currencies.




The expert’s foresight was expressed in an interview in 1999. In this conversation, Milton Friedman prophesied a future where the Internet would play an essential role in reducing state intervention. The economist predicted the advent of electronic currencies facilitating anonymous transactions—a revolutionary concept at the time that prefigured the impact of cryptos like Bitcoin.
Milton Friedman’s prediction highlighted on the one hand the potential of digital currencies to improve the privacy and efficiency of financial transactions. But it mainly underscored their broader implications for economic freedom. Coincidentally, the expert’s prophecy encapsulates the very essence of a reliable electronic money system that enables transparent funding transfers without revealing the identities of the parties involved.
It is safe to say that Friedman’s contributions to economic theory have found a deep echo in the realms of crypto and blockchain. He recognized that the Internet would disrupt traditional government revenue streams, especially tax collection, thus paving the way for decentralized financial systems. These intuitions were confirmed with the advent of Bitcoin, orchestrated by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.
The appearance of the flagship crypto signaled a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, embodying the principles of decentralization and electronic currency envisioned by Friedman. This transformative innovation catalyzed the development of new financial technologies, supporting economic freedom and innovation. Transcending his era, Milton Friedman’s foresight offered a premonitory glimpse of the future of digital finance. His vision of decentralized currencies and electronic money now serves as a cornerstone for understanding the profound impact of cryptos on the modern economy. Another seasoned economist also predicted the emergence of Bitcoin. That would be Friedrich A. Hayek.
The Avant-Garde Vision of F. A. Hayek Paving the Way for Bitcoin
Hayek’s ideas, particularly his allusion to a concept reminiscent of the flagship crypto, illuminate the trajectory of monetary innovation. Indeed, they foreshadow a future monetary landscape characterized by decentralized currencies. In a notable video from 1984, Hayek discussed the evolution of money, lamenting state interventions that stifled its development. He expressed skepticism about traditional monetary policies, advocating instead for the “denationalization of money.”
The idea was revolutionary for its time, considering the accepted notion that currency is one of the attributes of a country’s sovereignty. The Nobel laureate in economics, like Milton Friedman, envisaged a future where the free market would dictate the creation, allocation, and monitoring of money—an evolution that today has become a reality.
Hayek had notably proposed a privatization project for currency issuance, advocating a laissez-faire approach to monetary governance. Following this advocacy, initiatives such as the Liberty Dollar and E-gold emerged but eventually encountered regulatory hurdles and were ultimately abandoned.
Hayek did not live long enough to see his ideas come to fruition. However, the fact remains. Bitcoin appears in many ways as a manifestation of his vision. Notably, it operates without a centralized authority and has introduced a decentralized accounting system, echoing Hayek’s call for monetary denationalization. Bitcoin embodies the idea of Hayek to foster innovation through indirect means, bypassing established regulatory frameworks.




Fundamentally, F. A. Hayek’s foresight paved the way for the unprecedented rise of Bitcoin. This illustrates the profound impact of visionary economic thought on modern monetary evolution. His advocacy for decentralized currencies continues to resonate and shape the discourse on the future of finance and monetary governance.
Henry Ford, the Pioneer of the Energy-Based Currency Concept
Over a hundred years ago, Henry Ford, known as the industrialist and founder of the famous automobile brand that bears his name, had a premonition. He envisioned an “energy currency” capable of transcending geopolitical conflicts and redefining global finance. “Ford would replace gold with an energy currency and put an end to wars,” headlined an article in the New York Tribune published on December 4, 1921.
Later on, Henry Ford presented his revolutionary concept of energy currency. His central idea: to harness energy, measured in kilowatt-hours, as a tangible and scarce asset, to support the value of a digital currency. That is approximately what Satoshi Nakamoto realized to materialize Bitcoin.
It must be said that Henry Ford’s idea was not just the wild imaginings of a wealthy idler. Indeed, Ford went beyond mere theoretical speculation by identifying the Muscle Shoals Dam as potentially relevant to implement his ambitious initiative. For the record, the Muscle Shoals Dam, located along the Tennessee River with its abundant energy production, embodied Ford’s vision. He wanted to exploit its natural potential to drive a new era of financial innovation.
Henry Ford’s energy currency never materialized as originally envisioned. However, his visionary ideas resonate deeply within the context of the current evolution of digital currencies. Decentralized cryptos like Bitcoin, championed by luminaries such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, have a specific characteristic. They embody the principles of scarcity, autonomy, and resilience promoted by Ford.
Currently, these digital currencies offer a compelling alternative to traditional monetary systems, challenging the supremacy of gold and fiat currencies. The rise of Bitcoin as a store of value and a means of exchange underscores a certain “growing desirability of moving away from gold” among investors and the public at large.
This signals a paradigm shift towards decentralized financial systems. As the world witnesses the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, Ford’s premonition recalls the transformative potential inherent in bold ideas. His vision may have been ahead of its time, but its enduring relevance underscores the timeless pursuit of innovation and progress, especially in the realm of finance.","['SATS', 'VSN', 'SATOSHI', 'LT', 'BTC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea1a4a35539f471eb40944/

Bitcoin Options Market Signals Upward Trend as Expiry Nears,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 22:59:50.633416,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Bitcoin Options Market Signals Upward Trend as Expiry Nears
Recent analysis of the Bitcoin options market reveals an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency‘s price movement ahead of the month-end expiration. Jag Kooner, Bitfinex’s Head of Futures Products, highlights a significant trading volume in monthly and mid-month expiry call options with a $70,000 strike price since Bitcoin’s peak value. This trend suggests that investors anticipate a substantial increase in Bitcoin’s price.
Market Sentiment Tilts Toward Optimism
The Deribit exchange, a leader in Bitcoin options, has seen a surge in the volume of call options at the $70,000 strike price, signaling a bullish sentiment among traders. The put-call ratio, a key indicator of market sentiment, stands notably below the neutral mark of 1.0, with a six-month low of 0.6 and an even more promising 24-hour ratio of 0.47. This metric indicates that more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price rise rather than its decline.
Volatility Expectations and Option Premiums Dip
Kooner observes a recent dip in market volatility, with a consequential decrease in the cost of option premiums. With the Deribit volatility index for Bitcoin dropping from 77% to 72% in just one day, the market projects calmer waters ahead. This reduction in volatility predictions lowers the risk associated with options trading, leading to cheaper premiums and potentially more market participation.
Options trading involves derivatives that give buyers the right to purchase (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset at predetermined prices before a specified date. These financial instruments are pivotal in gauging market sentiment, with put buyers generally viewed as bearish and call buyers as bullish on the market’s future trajectory.
The strong interest in Bitcoin call options and the dropping put-call ratio point to a collective market belief in upcoming positive price action. As the expiration date approaches, the market’s eyes are keenly watching these signals, which may forecast the next wave of Bitcoin’s price movement.

Bitcoin Stands on a Pivotal Price Edge: Huge Futures Positions Risk Liquidation,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 22:59:51.934809,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Bitcoin Stands on a Pivotal Price Edge: Huge Futures Positions Risk Liquidation
Recent market data reveals that Bitcoin‘s price is at a crucial juncture where a minor dip could trigger a $2 billion liquidation of long positions in the futures market. After achieving a peak value, Bitcoin’s price underwent a swift $10,000 downturn, only to rebound shortly after. Investors have heavily invested in predictions tied to Bitcoin’s future price movements, creating a high-stakes environment on trading platforms.
High-Stakes Betting in the Bitcoin Market
Current trade positions show that a small price shift could have massive implications. A drop to $64,286 would liquidate long positions worth $2 billion, and a further slip to $60,000 would dissolve $2.33 billion of investments. Conversely, if Bitcoin surpasses its all-time high, shorts amounting to $1.31 billion face liquidation, increasing to $1.57 billion should the price hit $70,000.
Analysts Weigh In on Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory
The psychological impact of the all-time high region is influencing market behavior, with some participants looking to capitalize on investments made during the previous peak. Analysts are divided on Bitcoin’s potential for growth, with a mix of high expectations and more conservative views regarding the likelihood of a nearing top price. Prominent investor Michael van de Poppe speculated on a rally up to $70,000 to capitalize on market liquidity before a possible downturn.
The market’s volatility is evident as the BTC/USD pair recently displayed $1,000 shifts within mere minutes. This showcase of volatility underscores the highly reactive nature of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the looming Bitcoin block subsidy halving event in April adds another layer of speculation regarding the future of Bitcoin’s valuation, with some analysts predicting substantial corrections post-event.
As the cryptocurrency landscape braces for potential price swings, the community keenly watches the market’s reaction to these critical price thresholds. Such movements could significantly impact the sentiment and strategy of investors and traders alike.

Recent buzz in the cryptocurrency sphere surrounds a potential alliance between the altcoin project Aptos and tech giant Microsoft. A hint toward this significant collaboration came from an Aptos team member’s social media teaser, quickly capturing the community’s attention. While the details remain unofficial, the prospect of such a partnership has stirred discussions about its impact on the project’s visibility and the altcoin’s value.
Teasing a Tech Giant Collaboration
Neil, an Aptos staff member, shared a suggestive post alluding to a liaison with Microsoft. The news spread like wildfire, leading many to believe that the partnership might already be in place. The nature of the announcement has kept the community abuzz, anticipating the potential benefits of a union between the blockchain project and the global technology leader.
Market Impact on Aptos Valuation
Despite the excitement over the hinted collaboration, Aptos’ market price seems to have remained unaffected. As the community digests the news and speculates on the outcome, it’s important to note that only an employee has made the claim, without any confirmation from Microsoft itself. Investors and enthusiasts are closely monitoring the situation, looking for any fluctuation in Aptos’ trading price, which currently stands at $13.28.
The cryptocurrency market typically reacts to news of such partnerships, expecting a surge in the involved altcoin’s value. However, in the case of Aptos, the market response is still to be determined. This development presents an intriguing case study on how partnership news, especially when involving industry titans like Microsoft, can influence investor behavior and cryptocurrency valuations.
For now, the cryptocurrency community continues to watch the situation unfold, with hopes that an official announcement from either Aptos or Microsoft will soon provide clarity and possibly catalyze movements in the market.

Nissan launches metaverse experience blending car history with driver education,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 22:59:55.575649,"Nissan Motor Co. announced the launch of a new history and safety-themed metaverse experience on March 7. 
Called the “Heritage Cars & Safe Drive Studio,” the new exhibit combines immersive depictions featuring three of Nissan’s most iconic automobiles from history with interactive educational safety exhibits.
Per a press release from Nissan:

 “The studio commemorates Nissan's 90th anniversary year, which began in December. It features three iconic models from Nissan's past, each set in a meticulously crafted virtual environment that reflects its era.”

The first exhibit features the Silvia Q’s S13, a Nissan known throughout the world for its popularity as a drifting vehicle. In the Heritage Cars & Safe Driving studio, users can check out the historic vehicle and learn about the impact of pedestrian clothing colors on drivers.
In the second exhibit, users can play a mini-game focused on learning about a driver’s field-of-view and how multitasking affects safety while driving. They can also check out a Skyline 2000GTX-E, one of the most popular tuner vehicles of all time thanks to its prominence in popular culture outlets including the Gran Turismo video game series and the Fast and Furious film franchise.
The final exhibit takes users back to the United States in the 1950s and 60s in a setting “reminiscent of a classic American diner and drive-in theater” where they can participate in a hands-on steering wheel spin exercise.
All three experiences were developed in concert with researchers at universities in Japan. These new metaverse exhibits are available on the Meta Quest headset where they join previous entries from Nissan including the company’s first virtual test drive, which launched in 2022.
Nissan also refreshed four existing metaverse worlds in December of 2023 as part of its 90th anniversary celebration.
The company’s metaverse updates come as hardware solutions for AR and VR begin to mature. The launch of Apple’s first mixed-reality headset in February of 2024 signaled renewed competition for tech outfits such as Meta and Microsoft who’ve edged towards consumer and enterprise adoption over the past decade.

Nigeria’s apex bank taps Gluwa to accelerate e-Naira CBDC adoption,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 22:59:56.780654,"The Central Bank of Nigeria has partnered with Gluwa, a blockchain infrastructure firm, to drive the adoption of the country’s central bank digital currency, the e-Naira. 
The collaboration aims to promote the use of e-Naira and enhance financial inclusion in Nigeria by leveraging blockchain technology to advance financial inclusion, enhance the functionality of e-Naira, and drive financial innovation. 
The partnership will also focus on simplifying fintech lending by facilitating direct eNaira transfers to customers, streamlining the loan origination process, and enhancing service speed and efficiency. Additionally, it aims to authenticate transactions, ensuring the eNaira is the authoritative record for all loan transactions conducted by fintech partners and ensuring accuracy and transparency in financial operations and credit scoring.
Moreover, the collaboration will prioritize user authentication, implementing robust mechanisms such as asymmetric encryption with private and public keys to offer users secure, private, and regulatory-compliant access to financial services.
By streamlining remittance transfers, the eNaira can diminish costs, facilitating easier transactions for the Nigerian diaspora. Moreover, its account-based nature promises to inject transparency into informal payments, fortifying the tax base and formalizing economic transactions.
However, this transition to digital currency is not without its challenges. Monetary policy implementation and financial stability could face risks with the introduction of the eNaira. Measures such as daily transaction limits, identity verification protocols, and regular IT security assessments have been instituted to address cybersecurity concerns.

Nigeria regulates crypto 
Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly established new anti-money laundering guidelines for digital assets. The guidelines aim to enhance the licensing, registration, and screening processes for digital and virtual asset service providers (VASPs).
The Nigerian SEC’s initiative prevents individuals with criminal backgrounds from operating in the capital market, reinforcing market integrity and investor protection.
Furthermore, reports suggest that the SEC actively engages with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to incorporate additional feedback into the rules before final approval. This collaborative approach aims to strengthen regulations and ensure compliance within the digital asset space.
Nigerian regulatory authorities are seen as taking a proactive step to combat financial crimes in the digital asset sector by introducing these anti-money laundering guidelines. By setting clear rules and regulations, the SEC aims to create a compliant environment for legitimate VASPs while deterring illicit activities within the capital market.
The evolving regulatory landscape in Nigeria reflects a broader trend towards enhancing oversight and security in the digital asset ecosystem, aligning with global efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities.

Bitcoin, if it drops just $3,000 from current levels, $2 billion worth of Bitcoin long positions in the futures market will be liquidated. Data from CoinGlass indicates that investors are making big bets on the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. After reaching its all-time high on March 5th, Bitcoin lost $10,000 in value within hours before recovering, creating an intriguing situation on exchanges.
What Are Investors Predicting for Bitcoin?
According to data from TradingView, investors are making large predictions on both sides of the current spot price, which was trading at $67,788 after the Wall Street opening on March 7th. CoinGlass emphasizes how significant the amount at risk is.
For instance, to liquidate $2 billion worth of long Bitcoin positions in the futures market, the price only needs to drop to $64,286. If it falls to $60,000, then $2.33 billion worth of long positions will melt away, a figure higher than the bounce zone of the $10,000 red daily candle.
On the upside, breaking the all-time high of $69,210 will liquidate approximately $1.31 billion worth of Bitcoin short positions, and the liquidation value will reach $1.57 billion at $70,000.

As a reminder of market capability, the BTC/USD pair saw a $1,000 move up and down within minutes after the last Wall Street opening. Popular investor Daan Crypto Trades commented on the matter:

“Now we’re seeing $1,000 candles forming in one minute. Welcome to volatility city.”

Key Statements from Renowned Analysts
Recently, the all-time high region has been a significant psychological barrier for current Bitcoin market participants. Beyond this, some investors have been waiting for years to sell assets bought at previous all-time highs in November 2021, anticipating price discovery.
Analysts’ views on how high the BTC/USD pair can go vary greatly, with calls for six-figure targets mingling with predictions of a near peak. Included in the second group is Michael van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading. In a post shared by MNTrading, he stated:

“What’s next? As a scenario, we will go up to $70,000 and grab the liquidity.”

Later, Van de Poppe expressed the idea that there is little room left for the price of Bitcoin to rise before the block subsidy halving event in April. The famous analyst argued that when the correction comes, it could be 30%.

"Elon Musk led Tesla’s 11,510 Bitcoin stash revealed by Arkham",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-07 22:00:04.164829,"Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm, has reportedly identified Bitcoin addresses held by Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX. The on chain tracker claims to be the first entity to publicly identify the Bitcoin holdings of these giants. However, it contends that these on-chain fund flows align with the financial statements from Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla in big Bitcoin profits 
Elon Musk’s Tesla reveals its Bitcoin holdings, HODL or not?According to the data provided by Arkham, Tesla currently holds approximately 11,510 Bitcoins in 68 addresses (approx worth $780 million). However, SpaceX on the other hand holds around 8,290 Bitcoins in different 28 addresses (approx worth $560 million).
Tesla made a huge investment move of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in January 2021.  It is being reported that the company sold its BTC holdings on two occasions. The selling occasion came in Q1 2021. It sold $272 million worth of Bitcoin while it sold $936 million in Q2 2022. The on-chain analysis supports these reported transactions.
Arkham suggests that Tesla’s current profit on Bitcoin is $476 million. This profit calculation likely considers the difference between the purchase price of the Bitcoin and the sale proceeds.
It is important to note that Tesla allowed purchases of its electric vehicles using Bitcoin between March 24 and May 12, 2021. Arkham’s Intel Exchange Bounty reportedly revealed a Tesla car purchase linked to a larger cluster of its Bitcoin holdings. How much does SpaceX hold? 
If we talk about SpaceX, according to Arkham, it is holding Bitcoin valued at approximately $560 million. The firm has identified 28 Bitcoin addresses associated with SpaceX. The report provides insights into the dynamics of Bitcoin holdings for both Tesla and SpaceX, including purchase and sale transactions.
The major revelation comes in when Bitcoin is making the crypto industry go gaga. Bitcoin price is by 57% in the last 30 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $67,806, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is down by 53% to stand at $50 billion. However, Bitcoin is holding at market cap of $1.33 trillion.
It is still undisclosed how much Dogecoin (DOGE) both companies are holding. Elon Musk has already shown his likeness towards DOGE in different events. His one post on social media can send the meme token up to the moon.
However, Dogecoin price is up by 98% in the last 30 days. DOGE is trading at an average price of $0.1558, at the press time.

Bitcoin Options Indicate Bullish Momentum as Expiry Approaches,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 22:00:05.302047,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Bitcoin Options Indicate Bullish Momentum as Expiry Approaches
According to an analyst, Bitcoin options indicate a bullish momentum for the upcoming end-of-month expiry, as evidenced by strike position and put-call ratio. Jag Kooner, the Head of Futures Products at Bitfinex, stated that since Bitcoin reached its all-time high, the most traded instruments by volume have been monthly and mid-month expiry call options with a $70,000 strike price.
What’s Happening in the Futures Market?
The concentration of call options with a $70,000 strike price for both the weekend of March 8 and the end-of-month expiry in March on Deribit, the world’s largest Bitcoin options platform, has caught the attention of many analysts. Kooner suggests that the current put-call ratio of Bitcoin options indicates investors are leaning towards a bullish trend. Kooner made the following statement:

“The put-call ratio has consistently stayed below 0.6 for the first time in six months, and the 24-hour put-call ratio is at an even more bullish 0.47.”


According to The Block’s Data Dashboard, the global put-call ratio for Bitcoin options is currently at 0.6. A put-call ratio below 1 signifies bullish momentum, indicating more interest in potential upward movement. Conversely, a put-call ratio above 1 typically points to a bearish trend and shows more interest in downward protection.

Details on the Futures Market
The Head of Futures Products at Bitfinex noted that the high volatility in the options market has recently decreased, which points to lower volatility expectations among investors in the last 24 hours. As a result, the option premium has dropped across all strike prices, making it cheaper to take positions. Deribit’s volatility index for Bitcoin has fallen from 77% to 72% in the last 24 hours. Kooners commented on the matter:

“Lower volatility values typically lead to a decrease in option premiums because the expectation of a lack of volatility in the future compared to the past provides lower risk for options market participants.”

Options are derivative contracts that give an investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a certain date. A call option grants the right to buy, while a put option grants the right to sell. It is assumed that an investor who buys a put option is indirectly bearish on the market, while a call option buyer is considered bullish.

The altcoin market has recently been northbound, with the rapidly rising AI, gaming, and meme coin market. As such, investors are looking for coins within this sector, as FOMO is driving trading transactions upward.
New tokens and presales are attracting investors as they offer impressive growth potential. This review explores their use cases, performance metrics, and important news surrounding these coins.
New Cryptocurrency Releases, Listings & Presales Today
With ten stages left, Bitcoin Minetrix’s adoption is growing, amassing over $11.8 million in its current stage 30. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF breaks the record of net inflows, indicating the potential for the bull run to continue. Similarly, new releases have debuted on exchanges like CMC and Coingecko. 
1. DexToro (DTORO)
DexToro, a decentralized derivatives trading platform, has introduced its unique utility token, DTORO. This token is designed to sustain the long-term growth of the protocol. In addition, it serves three primary functions: staking, trading rewards, and governance.
Staking DTORO tokens entitles holders to a share of protocol revenue and additional trading rewards. However, these are slightly inflated compared to those earned by non-staking traders. Nonetheless, the aim is to incentivize both token holders to stake. 



Traders are encouraged to purchase tokens or reinvest their trading rewards into staking. As such, they can capitalize on the increased trading rewards for active stakers. Meanwhile, the trading rewards are directly tied to the total fees paid. This means the more one trades, the more DTORO tokens one earns.
Furthermore, DexToro offers a proprietary product, the DexToro “Smart Wallet.” This innovative wallet leverages account abstraction and smart contract wallet technology. Likewise, it provides distinct Features over centralized exchanges, order book-based DEXs, and traditional AMM-based DEXs. 
DexToro’s peer-to-contract (P2C) trading mechanism ensures zero slippage, zero price impact trades, and minimal fees. It also protects against front-running and MEV bots and rapid trade executions. DTORO was launched on October 10th, 2023, with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens.

Pullix (PLX) Outshines Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) As It Debuts In The Space,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-07 22:00:08.688263,"The bull run anticipation for this year has more or less begun, with top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) tokens leading the charge. Both cryptocurrencies have gained a lot in the past month with their price chart indiscriminately exhibiting a highly bullish trajectory. Meanwhile, a new DeFi coin and hybrid exchange platform, Pullix (PLX), is showing potential to outshine Ethereum and Solana as it debuts on the mainstream cryptocurrency market.
Ethereum (ETH) Aims for $4,000 As It Achieve Giant Bullish Strides In The Past Month
Ethereum (ETH)’s price trajectory has been pretty impressive in the past month as the native ETH token was able to gain by over 61%, taking its price to a strong point above its coveted $3,600. Currently, Ethereum token is holding in a weekly price range of $3,217 and $3,822, however, considering the 92% bullish rating from its community, Ethereum should break more resistance zones anytime soon.
In the past week, Ethereum has gained by 14.14% despites having to battle a series of fluctuations that posed a threat to its bullish stance. Now, Ethereum maintains a highly bullish outlook that seems to be driving the token to $4,000. 
Solana (SOL) Keeps Up With Its Achievements of Newer Peak Prices
In the past year, Solana has shocked many investors with how meteoric its price growth was. Despite registering a yearly gain of over 513%, Solana price has been stuck within a weekly price range of $106.74 and $135.71. However, Solana coin will inevitably price higher, considering it just gained by over 34.22% in the past month.
Experts think that Solana will definitely be one of the top gainers this year, following suit with the likes of Ethereum and Pullix. The network of Solana is one of the most impressive and with over 17.55% gain in the past 7 days, more evidence points to the reality of an imminent price surge for Solana.
Pullix (PLX) Shows Off Monumental Growths With Successful Presale Run and A Listing on Uniswap 
After completing its presale stage, Pullix (PLX) isn’t slowing down as it adds another exchange listing to its achievements. Following a listing on CoinGecko more than a month ago, the new DeFi coin has secured another listing on Uniswap, and also plans to debut itself on CEX exchange platform, BitMart, on the 7th of March.
Pullix has garnered significant attention by offering a distinctive hybrid exchange platform that combines elements of both DeFi and CeFi marketplaces. Notably, this innovative approach aims to deliver a seamless trading and exchange experience, prioritizing high liquidity, transparency, user accountability, and robust security measures. 
In order to ensure stability and trust within its ecosystem Pullix intends to lock $PLX liquidity on Uniswap for a duration of two years. This strategic move underscores the commitment to establishing a solid foundation for its lightning-fast trading platform, further solidifying it as one of the best DeFi projects.
Remarkably, within just 40 minutes of its launch on Uniswap, its trading activity has surged, with over $1.35 million worth of Pullix tokens already exchanged. This impressive volume reflects the market’s growing recognition of Pullix as a pioneering force in the future of finance.  
Meanwhile, the platform has already attracted over 20,000 users and the launch price was set at $0.168. Looking ahead, it is now trading over $0.40 with a market cap over $85.6 million and a rapidly growing user base, Pullix holds ample investment potential.

7 March, 2024 – Core Foundation has announced a $5 million Innovation Fund to advance India’s dApp ecosystem on Core Chain, the Bitcoin-secured and EVM-compatible blockchain. This fund aims to empower Web3 communities, enhance education, and provide vital support to founders and builders throughout India.
“India’s startup energy is unmatched, and its Web3 ecosystem is no exception, booming with over 450 startups and $1.3 billion in investments. Our goal is to empower Indian builders, spur dApp growth, and merge Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility.

EOS Coin Price Soars After Supply Reduction Announcement,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 22:00:12.947311,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: EOS Coin Price Soars After Supply Reduction Announcement
A recent declaration concerning a supply cut has led to a sharp increase in the value of the cryptocurrency EOS. Initially trading at $1.2, EOS’s price began its ascent from around $1.1 shortly after the news became public. This development has significantly impacted investor interest and market activity for the altcoin.
What’s Behind EOS’s Price Spike?
Yves La Rose, CEO of EOS, took to an official channel to reveal that the company plans to eliminate half of EOS’s total supply. This announcement triggered a price boost, with the coin reaching $1.2102. While Bitcoin targets the $68,000 mark, EOS has delivered optimistic news, which is expected to influence its market price shortly.
The decision to slash the supply could potentially push EOS’s market valuation beyond the $2 billion threshold. Such a scenario may pave the way for the coin’s price to climb over $2. At present, the price hovers around $1.25 as of 21:51 (TSI), and it appears that investors are still digesting the announcement and have yet to adjust their market positions accordingly.
Market Reaction and Speculation
The market’s response to EOS’s supply cut is being closely monitored, as the strategy could have lasting implications for the coin’s value. Speculation is rife that if the reduced supply is well-received, EOS may experience a sustained price increase, thereby attracting more investors and potentially altering its market dynamics.
Experts and investors alike are keeping a keen eye on the developments surrounding EOS, anticipating the potential for a new price equilibrium and the broader impact on the cryptocurrency market.

XRP Sees Major Growth in User Adoption and Market Distribution,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 22:00:14.077757,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: XRP Sees Major Growth in User Adoption and Market Distribution
A recent surge in user adoption and distribution has marked XRP, the world’s sixth-largest cryptocurrency, with over five million accounts now holding a cumulative 59.8 billion XRP. This uptick in activity suggests a growing interest in the digital asset, coinciding with an overall positive trend in the crypto market.
Surge in XRP Holdings
Data from Xrpl Services indicates a significant boost in XRP’s distribution, with nearly five million accounts actively holding the digital currency. Of these, only a minuscule fraction has zero balances, pointing to a robust market appetite for XRP. This expansion in XRP’s user base is a testament to the cryptocurrency’s appeal and potential for broader adoption.
Impact of Market Trends on XRP
XRP’s attractiveness to investors has been bolstered by a recent legal clarification in the United States, which determined that XRP should not be classified as a security. Additionally, the general upswing in the crypto market, which saw its total value cross the $2 trillion threshold and Bitcoin reach new heights, has also positively affected XRP’s market presence.
Institutional Investment Gathers Momentum
Despite not performing as strongly as some of its counterparts, XRP has demonstrated a resilient user base, as shown by the volume of accounts and holdings. CoinShares reports highlight continuing institutional interest, with a notable $2.5 million inflow into XRP investments recorded in a single week.
In the current trading scenario, XRP has experienced a price uptick to $0.628, marking a growth of 4.26% in the last day. This recovery follows a downturn on March 5th, with the cryptocurrency showing signs of a bullish trend amid fluctuating market conditions. The positive momentum also reflects in its Turkish Lira trading value, standing at around 20.23.

Significant Adoption and Distribution Growth for XRP Cryptocurrency,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 22:00:16.316980,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Significant Adoption and Distribution Growth for XRP Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency world’s sixth-largest currency, XRP, has experienced a notable increase in adoption and distribution, now held by over five million accounts with a total of 59.8 billion XRP, according to recent data from XRP Ledger explorer Xrpl Services. This development could signal a critical stage for XRP. However, it is necessary to take into account the XRP held by Ripple itself.
XRP Adoption
According to data from the Xrpl service platform, there are 5,089,197 XRP accounts. Only 1,592 of these have a zero balance. This indicates that approximately 59,879,274,264 XRP is distributed across nearly five million accounts, showing a significant increase in demand and interest in this digital asset.

In 2023, a US judge clarified that XRP is not a security in itself, providing regulatory certainty to the cryptocurrency and further strengthening investor confidence.
The overall upward trend in the cryptocurrency market, where the total market value exceeded 2 trillion dollars and Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $69,000, also contributed to XRP’s success.
Increased Institutional Interest and Inflows
Despite XRP’s relatively low performance compared to other altcoins, data revealing the number of accounts and total XRP holdings indicate resilience among XRP holders.
According to CoinShares, XRP continues to attract interest and demand from institutional investors, with recent reports showing an inflow of $2.5 million just last week.
How Much is Ripple in Turkish Lira?
At the time of writing this article, XRP has risen to $0.628, a 4.26% increase over the past 24 hours, marking its second consecutive recovery day after a sharp decline on March 5th. The cryptocurrency reached its intraday high of $0.63 and the next target is set at $0.67. In Turkish Lira, Ripple is trading at the level of 20.23.

Bears pushed the price down from the $0.67 level on March 5th. However, $0.63 has become a support point. With bulls entering the fray, XRP may fluctuate between the 50-day SMA and $0.67 in the near term, suggesting range-bound trading.
Nevertheless, the recovery from the 50-day SMA level of $0.547 indicates that bulls are still buying on significant dips. XRP has the potential to make another attempt to overcome the general resistance at the $0.67 level, potentially paving the way for a rise towards $0.74.

Demand is extremely important for cryptocurrencies, and a recent announcement has caused the altcoin EOS to surge rapidly. At the time of writing, EOS Coin, which was trading at $1.2, started rallying from the $1.1 region following the announcement a few minutes ago.
Why Is EOS Rising?
EOS CEO Yves La Rose announced via the official X account that half of the supply would be burned. Following this announcement, we saw the price rise to $1.2102. Currently, while the BTC price is targeting $68,000, EOS has given the best news possible, and we will observe the reflections of this on the price in the next few hours.

Halving the supply means that the current market value could exceed $2 billion. This could open the door to an EOS Coin price above $2. For now, as of 21:51 (TSI), the price is challenging $1.25, and investors do not seem to have fully believed the big news yet, nor have they started to take positions accordingly.

El Salvador reports a 40% gain on its Bitcoin holdings, challenging critic Peter Schiff. Meanwhile, InQubeta, a new AI cryptocurrency, gains traction.
A series of positive developments in the crypto market have sparked widespread interest and debate. El Salvador’s bold move to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender was initially met with acclaim and skepticism. 
President Nayib Bukele’s recent announcement of a 40% profit margin on the nation’s Bitcoin holdings seems to have made a mockery of criticisms from figures like Peter Schiff. Amidst this backdrop, a new ICO, InQubeta, is making waves in the AI cryptocurrency space.

President Nayib Bukele took to social media to share the success story of El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment, revealing a staggering 40% potential profit. 
This announcement comes against the backdrop of previous criticisms, particularly when Bitcoin’s value plummeted. 
Despite the naysayers, Bukele’s strategy reflects a long-term vision: it leverages cryptocurrency to bolster the nation’s economy without immediate plans to liquidate the assets.
The debate between Bukele and Schiff represents a larger conversation about the viability and future of best cryptocurrencies as national assets. 
While Schiff advocates for a more traditional investment approach, emphasizing gold, Bukele’s stance on Bitcoin underscores a progressive shift towards digital currencies, reflecting broader global trends towards decentralization and digital finance.

The platform’s success is evident from its presale, which generated over $10.9 million. To expand its ecosystem further, plans are in place for an NFT marketplace, a swapping platform, and a DAO.

As such, investors are looking for coins within this sector, as FOMO is driving trading transactions upward.

Meanwhile, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF breaks the record of net inflows, indicating the potential for the bull run to continue. Similarly, new releases have debuted on exchanges like CMC and Coingecko. 
1. DexToro (DTORO)
DexToro, a decentralized derivatives trading platform, has introduced its unique utility token, DTORO. This token is designed to sustain the long-term growth of the protocol. In addition, it serves three primary functions: staking, trading rewards, and governance.
Staking DTORO tokens entitles holders to a share of protocol revenue and additional trading rewards. However, these are slightly inflated compared to those earned by non-staking traders. Nonetheless, the aim is to incentivize both token holders to stake. 

Traders are encouraged to purchase tokens or reinvest their trading rewards into staking. As such, they can capitalize on the increased trading rewards for active stakers. Meanwhile, the trading rewards are directly tied to the total fees paid. This means the more one trades, the more DTORO tokens one earns.
Furthermore, DexToro offers a proprietary product, the DexToro “Smart Wallet.” This innovative wallet leverages account abstraction and smart contract wallet technology. Likewise, it provides distinct features over centralized exchanges, order book-based DEXs, and traditional AMM-based DEXs. 
DexToro’s peer-to-contract (P2C) trading mechanism ensures zero slippage, zero price impact trades, and minimal fees. It also protects against front-running and MEV bots and rapid trade executions. DTORO was launched on October 10th, 2023, with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens.

Wharton Professor Predicts Victory for Custodia Bank in Legal Battle with Federal Reserve,COIN_MARKET_CAP,DeFi Planet,2024-03-07 22:00:23.232123,"
Peter Conti-Brown, a professor at the Wharton School and famous financial historian, has opined that a looming victory might be ahead for the Custodia Bank in its legal battle with the Federal Reserve. 

Professor Conti-Brown shared this opinion as an interpretation of the recent judicial developments on the issue in a recent post on X. His post contained a screenshot of the Court order cancelling the trial setting, final pretrial conference, and associated filing deadlines. 
Custodia Bank is one of the few mainstream banks in the U.S. to adopt a cryptocurrency-friendly stance. In late 2020, the bank submitted an application for a master account to become part of the Federal Reserve System. This move will allow the bank direct access to the Fedwire network, which is crucial for facilitating massive-volume instant transactions. The bank argued that acquiring direct access to the Federal Reserve, instead of passing through intermediary banks, would enable it to minimize costs and boost its cryptocurrency strategy. 
However, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City denied the application over concerns regarding Custodia’s proposed “novel and untested digital asset activities”. The federal agency also stated that Custodia’s risk management framework wasn’t sufficient to mitigate the heightened risks related to its proposed digital asset activities, especially money laundering and terrorism financing risks.
In response, Custodia filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve, accusing the agency of unlawfully delaying its application. The lawsuit is ongoing, with no final ruling from the court. The recent court order has nullified the initial trial date of April 8, allowing the case to proceed through regular channels. Notably, Conti-Brown is actively involved in researching the legislative history relevant to the lawsuit on behalf of Custodia.
However, not many quarters agree with Conti-Brown’s optimistic interpretation of the court’s statements. Critics argue that the court’s eagerness to decide on the suit’s merits without proceeding to trial could be perceived as biased in favour of the Federal Reserve.

Pantera Capital Is Raising Funds to Buy $250 Million Worth of SOL From FTX Estate – Bloomberg Report,COIN_MARKET_CAP,DeFi Planet,2024-03-07 22:00:24.417941,"
Pantera Capital is reportedly seeking to raise funds for the purchase of $250 million worth of SOL tokens from FTX Estate.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the crypto-focused asset management firm aims to establish a Pantera Solana Fund and acquire a portion of FTX’s SOL holdings at a discounted price of $59.95. This discount price represents a 57% reduction from SOL’s current price of $143.81, as per CoinMarketCap data.
The development was evident in the marketing documents (which were reviewed by Bloomberg) sent to potential investors as they outlined Pantera’s execution strategy. According to these documents, the FTX Estate currently holds 41.1 million SOL tokens, valued at approximately $5.4 billion, constituting around 10% of the entire circulating supply of Solana. 
Pantera is encouraging investors to commit a minimum of $25 million each and agree to have a corresponding amount of SOL coins locked on the platform for an initial vesting period exceeding four years. The asset management giant’s proposed fee structure includes a 0.75% management fee and a 10% performance fee. 
Notably, Pantera’s plan offers FTX liquidators a gradual way to sell their Solana holdings, preventing an immediate impact on SOL trading prices and generating funds for creditors.
Meanwhile, SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, witnessed a significant surge in its price in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap data, the current price of $144.83 reflects a 13.96% increase from the previous day’s trading price and a 9.01% growth over the week. Over the past 12 months, the token’s price has experienced a 640% increase, aligning with the overall bullish market trend driven primarily by Bitcoin’s current price trajectory.

The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant event as a large sum of Ethereum (ETH) was transferred to Binance, a prominent crypto exchange. The transaction involved 26,889 ETH, equivalent to over $102 million, catching the attention of market watchers. This transfer coincided with Ethereum’s price peaking at levels not seen since January 2022.
Turbulence in the Crypto Market
The sizable movement of funds was detected and reported by Whale Alert, a service that tracks major cryptocurrency transactions. Although the identity of the party behind the transfer remains a mystery, such activities typically stir market speculation. With Ethereum’s value spiking by 9% in the preceding week, theories regarding the transfer’s purpose ranged from a potential major sell-off to strategic investment movements.
Ethereum’s Potential to Set New Records
Despite Ethereum’s recent climb, which sent its value above $3,800, it still falls short of its all-time high of $4,868. The crypto community is abuzz with discussions about Ethereum’s capacity to break through its previous record. Large transactions to exchanges like this one are often viewed as indicators of impending sales, while withdrawals may suggest a forecasted price increase.
The intentions behind the transfer remain speculative, especially as Ethereum’s price surge paralleled the event. Market analysts closely watch such movements for hints of future market trends, understanding that these can profoundly affect the price and sentiment around a cryptocurrency.
The cryptocurrency domain is known for its volatility, and substantial transactions like the one observed are critical in shaping market dynamics. While predicting the market’s reaction to such events is challenging, they are essential to observe for anyone involved in the crypto sphere. At the moment, Ethereum trades at $3,807, with market participants closely watching its next moves.

The development was announced by EOS Foundation CEO Yves La Rose, who shared a post on his official X account. In the post, there is a phrase like “EOS:2” and a Sesame Street character in flames is observed in the image. However, details for the burning in question have not yet been shared.
EOS, one of the older generation altcoins, has long been criticized for its poor performance. The altcoin hit an all-time high of $22.89 in 2018. At the time of writing this article, it is trading at $1.32, with a huge 27% increase after the development.

Update:
According to the latest information, it turned out that the founder of EOS did not mean to burn half of the EOS supply. As a main development, it was reported that EOS inflation will end, 818 million new EOS tokens will be minted, the EOS supply will be limited to 2 billion tokens, and there will be aggressive token market launches in the first stage, which will later be reduced with a logarithmic curve.

"Saga gaming token airdrop launches on Solana, other networks",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 22:00:27.950924,"Saga, a gaming-centric network, initiated its airdrop claim process on Wednesday, including Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos, Celestia, and Polygon.
This airdrop is eligible for over 200,000 unique wallets from those networks. The airdrop enables winners of its recent three-month play-to-airdrop competitions and certain crypto stakers to claim SAGA tokens.
The claims page is now accessible. Users can claim 60 million SAGA tokens until March 27. However, regional restrictions apply, specifically excluding citizens and residents of the United States.

Competitions for airdrop opportunities featured games from Saga’s testnet and other popular games from different chains, such as the card game Parallel and the shooter Shrapnel.
As detailed in Saga’s eligibility guide, Saga has allocated airdrop tokens to users who staked the native cryptocurrencies of Avalanche, Polygon, Celestia (TIA), and Cosmos (ATOM) during specified periods in 2023.
Saga, which has previously announced collaborations with Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC), positions itself as a platform for launching new chains.
“We’re in a really unique position to do it because we’re one of the few chains that has focused on the gaming use case that is not yet live,” Saga CEO and Co-Founder Rebecca Liao said. “And so we have that massive airdrop that can be done at Genesis. That has been enormously helpful for something like a play-to-airdrop mechanism.”
According to Liao, while the network’s primary focus is not limited to gaming, approximately 80% of early development on the testnet has been in the gaming sector.

Prometheum Issue Prompts US Watchdog To Call For Clarity On Whether Ethereum Is A Security,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 22:00:29.640458,"
Remarks relating to Prometheum by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Rostin Behnam have reignited calls for clarity on whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity.
This comes after Prometheum, the only U.S.-registered crypto securities platform, announced that the leading altcoin will be the first digital asset it will custody. In so doing, it is treating Ethereum as though it is a security while the firm’s regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has yet to clarify its view on the issue.
Indeed, in an interview with Bloomberg Television today, SEC chair Gary Gensler said he would ”defer on that question” of whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity.
Prometheum calls itself an “SEC registered, full-service market ecosystem for digital asset securities,” and says it is “a bridge from securities to crypto.”
Behnam says both Ethereum and Bitcoin are commodities, and questions any contrasting classification by the SEC.
 


Ethereum And Bitcoin Are Commodities By Default
The regulatory uncertainty was a focal point during an annual appearance before the House Agriculture Committee on Mar. 6.
 During the hearing, Behnam urged Congress to pass legislation regarding the matter. “We need to fill the gap in crypto regulation,” he said. Behnam then said the notion that crypto is “going away” is “just a false narrative, ” pointing to Bitcoin’s recent price performance as proof.

I look forward to testifying next week in front of the House Agriculture Committee to discuss the CFTC's agenda, enforcement program and challenges facing the agency. My testimony will be posted on the committee's website and @CFTC. https://t.co/cxafe0uTUb
— Rostin Behnam (@CFTCbehnam) February 28, 2024


When asked to explain why Bitcoin or other cryptos should be considered as commodities, Behnam said that this classification is “mostly used in the counter negative.” He elaborated by saying that the SEC’s inability to label Bitcoin and Ethereum as securities means that they are commodities by default.

The recent study by Chainalysis has shed light on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector’s trading activities, uncovering practices such as pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading. It highlights the manipulation of token prices by certain actors who drive up demand through misinformation before selling their own stakes for profit.
Launch and Liquidity of Crypto Tokens
In 2023, the Ethereum network saw the creation of over 370,000 new tokens, with roughly half of those making their way to decentralized exchanges. Chainalysis’ findings indicate that a minuscule fraction of these tokens garner significant liquidity post-launch, with only 1.4% crossing the $300 mark in decentralized exchange liquidity and a mere 5.7% maintaining it.
Limited Liquidity and Profit Extraction
The analysis also revealed that many of these assets display minimal liquidity, and in some cases, single transactions have withdrawn substantial amounts of liquidity from the market. This pattern, however, doesn’t necessarily implicate the involved assets in fraudulent schemes but rather serves as a method to spot potential irregularities in trading activities.
Despite these challenges, certain participants have managed to profit significantly from launching crypto assets. In 2023, a group of these actors gained approximately $241.6 million, with some repeatedly introducing multiple tokens to the market for considerable gain.
Jason Somensatto of Chainalysis has suggested that implementing a regulatory framework could mitigate issues like insider trading by establishing clear rules for trading platforms and authorizing a market regulator to enforce them. He points out the necessity for comprehensive data analysis across multiple platforms due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency trading, which contrasts with the traditional financial system’s reliance on single-exchange data.

Bonk Crypto Price Prediction – $SMOG & $SPONGEV2 Emerges As Top Meme Coins Alongside $BONK,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 22:00:33.042332,"
On March 5th, $BONK reached its all-time high, hitting $0.0000470, marking an impressive 184% increase over the last month. Given this remarkable surge, there is speculation that Bonk might experience a pullback, as it is currently down by 10% in the last 24 hours.
At present, the market sentiment is bullish, indicated by the Fear & Greed Index at 82 (Extreme Greed). However, it’s important to note that such periods of extreme greed are usually short-lived, implying a potentially limited timeframe for sustained bullish momentum.
Bonk has reached a noteworthy milestone by entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, signaling a significant achievement in its development. This impressive progress not only demonstrates the growing acceptance of $BONK but also indicates the changing trends within the crypto sphere.
The recent surge serves as a testament to the community’s confidence and the intrinsic value attributed to Bonk. This article will delve deeper into $BONK’s potential future trajectory and highlight two new meme coins with growth potential of 10x or more.





$BONK Crypto Price Prediction
As of the latest update, the price of Bonk stands at $0.0000291, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $549.90 million and a market capitalization of $1.90 billion. Over the past seven days, the price of $BONK has surged by more than 16%.
While the upward trend in Bonk’s price appears promising, there remains the potential for market corrections. Should it manage to surpass its nearest resistance level at $0.00003509, the long-term outlook could be optimistic, potentially attracting increased investor interest.



However, despite current recommendations to buy, it’s crucial to consider the presence of second support levels at $0.0000401 and $0.00000434, indicating inherent risks associated with Bonk.
It’s important to acknowledge that short-term fluctuations may occur, even amidst its newfound popularity, potentially driving its value towards these lower thresholds.
For more in-depth Analysis of Bonk’s crypto price prediction, view the video above and subscribe to Jacob Crypto Bury’s YouTube channel for additional crypto-related content. Jacob also runs a Discord server with 21,000 members, offering users trading tips and details into upcoming crypto presales.
Multi-Chain Smog Surges 328% – Analysts Recommend it as the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now
In the midst of Bonk’s surge, the cryptocurrency community is abuzz with the rapid rise of Smog (SMOG), a new contender that has gained attention with its remarkable 328% surge in the last seven days, reaching an all-time high of $0.310.
Smog sets itself apart by opting for a fair launch model, devoid of any presale, ensuring an equal playing field for all participants. Its distribution strategy centers around airdrops and community incentives.
Entering the market strategically during the meme coin frenzy, Smog leverages the Solana blockchain to attract investors. It further distinguishes itself by prioritizing airdrop campaigns over presales, fostering a strong and engaged community—a critical factor for sustained success.
Launched in early February, $SMOG Features innovative tokenomics geared towards incentivizing holders. Notably, 50% of the total supply is allocated for marketing campaigns, while 35% is reserved for airdrop rewards. Currently, Smog is running what it claims to be ‘the Greatest Airdrop in History.’

There are two ways to qualify for the biggest giveaway. The first entails acquiring and holding $SMOG, while the inventive Zealy campaign offers extra chances to earn airdrop points through specified tasks, like interacting with the project on social media platforms and visiting designated web pages.
With a fully diluted market cap of $401 million, $SMOG is carving out a niche in the meme coin sector. At the time of writing, Smog’s price is $0.282, reflecting a 50.91% increase in the last 24 hours. The momentum behind Smog remains strong, with over 63K holders and $13 million in trading volume within the past 24 hours.
The Smog website offers a 10% discount for over-the-counter purchases, alongside attractive staking rewards, boasting an annual yield of 42%, with over 19 million $SMOG tokens already locked up.
With Smog gaining traction on social media and expanding its integration with Ethereum, the token appears well-positioned for sustained growth and adoption.
Sponge V2 – Another Potential Gem in the Meme Coin Rally
Another meme coin worth keeping an eye on is Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2), the successor to the original $SPONGE meme coin launched in 2023, which delivered a 100x return. For investors who missed out on last year’s opportunity, the launch of the latest version of the meme coin offers a second chance.
With $SPONGE’s entry into the memecoin rally, the team is aiming for top-tier listings for $SPONGEV2, potentially sparking increased demand and price, attracting new investors, and ensuring sustained growth. Building on the legacy of Sponge V1, Sponge V2 introduces enhanced Features and added value for token holders.
Notably, the inclusion of staking provides an avenue for earning passive rewards. Existing Sponge V1 holders can stake their $SPONGE to earn Sponge V2 tokens. For those without SPONGE tokens, they can purchase them on the Sponge V2 official website, where over $22 million in total staked and bridged assets have already been recorded.

Holders can enjoy an impressive annual percentage yield (APY) of over 180% on Ethereum and 552% on Polygon. In addition to lining up several major exchange listings, Sponge V2 will introduce a play-to-earn (P2E) racer game, available in both paid and free versions.
In the paid version, players will use $SPONGEV2 tokens as credits for in-game assets and activities, with the chance to win rewards paid in the meme coin. This expansion into the blockchain gaming sector not only broadens the coin’s utility but also enhances its appeal.
With regard to $SPONGE, there may still be room for price growth given its current price and market cap. To acquire $SPONGEV2 token visit spongetoken.vip.

Solana-based defi lender Kamino Finance will conduct its on-chain snapshot on March 31 ahead of a crypto airdrop for eligible early supports expected in April. At launch, 10% of Kamino’s 10 billion total supply will enter circulation. 
Furthermore, its season one plan earmarked 7% of the total supply for Kamino’s Genesis community distribution. The token-sharing mechanism is linear, based on points users have accumulated over time. This means a user is entitled to 1% of the airdrop allocation if they own 1% of all points generated. 



$KMNO holders will be able to participate in governance regarding various parts of KaminoThe scope of governance will increase over time as the protocol trends towards full decentralization— Kamino (@KaminoFinance) March 7, 2024




The protocol’s KMNO token unlocks governance privileges for holders, allowing users to contribute to Kamino’s future operations. According to the team, KMNO will deliver future utilities like control over incentive programs, revenue allocation, and voting for risk management strategies. 
At launch, the Kamino Foundation will oversee the bulk of governance while laying the building blocks for progressive decentralization. The platform also announced a Season Two distribution roadmap emphasizing protocol participation and sustained user activity.

Sponge V2, a polygon-based meme coin, has soared 26%, hitting a $100m market cap and outperforming others with significant community support and new highs.
Trending meme coin Sponge has hit a $100 million market cap after recently surpassing its all-time high (ATH).
Soaring 26% in the last 24 hours, Sponge is receiving widespread community support as it carves a reputation as Polygon’s premier meme coin.
Sponge outperforms the market as it hits $100M
Sponge’s recent performance has been impressive, with a 75% increase in value this week alone. This surge comes shortly after its transition to the Polygon network and its evolution from Sponge V1 to V2, marking a new all-time high price of $0.002543.
The coin’s market valuation now stands at approximately $100.44 million. This achievement is noteworthy, especially considering the competition within the meme coin sector, where several coins have valuations exceeding $1 billion.

Comparative analysis and utility

Unlike many meme coins, Sponge has demonstrated a strong track record and unique utility aspects. 
It was launched in May 2023 and has since mirrored the success of other prominent meme coins, achieving significant growth. 
The community’s support has been vital, with over 13,000 holders and significant social media engagement.
However, after an initial hype phase, Sponge experienced a price consolidation. The team’s commitment led to the development of Sponge V2, introducing new utility features such as a Play-to-Earn racing game and improved staking mechanics. 
A free and paid version is available, with the paid game offering better rewards. However, users must buy credits with $SPONGEV2, adding a demand stream that helps mitigate the typical volatility of meme coins.
This transition to the Polygon network was strategic, offering lower fees and quicker transactions.

Insights into the Crypto Asset Market from Chainalysis Report,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 22:00:39.753978,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Insights into the Crypto Asset Market from Chainalysis Report
Even as the cryptocurrency market matures to resemble the traditional financial world, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector continues to witness free trade activities often subject to pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading processes. Pump-and-dump schemes usually consist of an actor or a group of actors manipulating token purchases through false claims, excitement, and fear of missing out, while secretly selling their own shares at higher prices.
Chainalysis Report on the Crypto Asset Market
According to some estimates, over two million cryptocurrencies have been launched to date, with most fading into the annals of history. A recent Chainalysis study indicates that more than 370,000 tokens were launched on the Ethereum network in 2023, with 168,600 listed on decentralized exchanges.
The study finds that less than 1.4% of all crypto assets launched in any given month achieve over $300 in DEX liquidity the following month, and only 5.7% of the crypto assets launched on Ethereum in 2023 are currently above this threshold.
The firm also discovered that approximately 90,408 crypto assets had less than $300 in liquidity on these exchanges, and a single address removed more than 70% of the liquidity in a single transaction with five or more previous DEX purchases. Chainalysis clarifies in its report that this does not mean the 90,408 crypto assets were involved in pump-and-dump schemes. Instead, it demonstrates how authorities can use on-chain data to identify suspicious patterns.

Actors launching crypto assets that meet these criteria collectively made approximately $241.6 million in profit in 2023, not accounting for other costs incurred to generate and launch the profits. Some launched multiple crypto assets meeting the criteria, with one identified wallet launching 81 different tokens and earning an estimated $830,000 in profit.
Notable Comments on the Subject
Chainalysis North America Head of Public Policy Jason Somensatto stated that adopting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets could help reduce insider trading by clarifying the rules that trading platforms must follow and establishing a market regulator with enforcement authority. Somensatto added the following:

“Unlike TradFi, where a security primarily trades on a single exchange, crypto assets trade on numerous platforms and decentralized financial protocols; this means that relying on data from a single trading venue, as has traditionally been done, is not sufficient.”

Users may trade with borrowed funds on the blockchain without having to worry about forced liquidations thanks to a novel technique known as Limitless Pools.Blackwing, which is built on the foundation provided by Initia and pushes the boundaries of modular chain architecture, maintains decentralization while facilitating easy trade across any modular app chain. Traders may trade assets from any modular app chain without moving funds across networks after they have placed funds on Blackwing, offering substantial cost savings and extra security.With years of expertise from Meta and Robinhood, both founders Shahmeer Navid and Zorayr Khalapyan demonstrate the team’s capacity to take on such a significant project and push the limits of the modular blockchain ecosystem.Blackwing’s lead investor, Baek Kim, partner at Hashed VC, states:

“Giving traders the ability to trade any asset from any chain with leverage without the fear of liquidation is a major step forward in DeFi and is a significant improvement in product experience, security, and costs for traders.”

Blackwing’s Limitless Pools provide a unique approach to leverage trading without liquidation. The platform makes sure that the initial position used for trading on borrowed funds may be rebuilt, regardless of variations in asset prices, by turning holdings held by liquidity providers into collateral. This new structure benefits traders by offering safer leverage, while liquidity providers gain by earning higher fees.Miko Matsumura, managing partner at gumi Cryptos Capital, said:

“This is a profoundly exciting new mechanism. This team has created a breakthrough model that is ultimately trader-friendly.”

A more decentralized ecosystem of app chains is replacing the conventional monolithic chains on the platform, as seen by its modular architecture. By reducing complexity and increasing efficiency, this paradigm enables cross-chain asset trading without the need for additional wallets or bridges.Co-founder, Shahmeer, states:

“Across the web3 ecosystem, we’re on a precipice of change with the introduction of modular chains. Instead of single, large monolithic chains dominating the ecosystem, we will see a Cambrian explosion of highly-specialized and scalable interwoven app chains that all work together to onboard the next generation of traders.”

Furthermore, Blackwing presents an intent-solver architecture that prioritizes achieving traders’ objectives while abstracting execution complexity. By making trading easier, this strategy hopes to free up customers’ time to focus on their investing goals.","['DEFI', 'META']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea09f135539f471eb40929/

UK police officer caught lying about crypto bags banned from force,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 22:01:04.109779,"



A UK police officer has been barred from the force after lying about hiding thousands of pounds in Crypto and showing a “serious lack of integrity” while claiming to be an amateur investor.  
As reported by the Harborough Mail, when Osama Hussain joined Leicestershire Police in 2022, he claimed to have invested £150 in Crypto, downplaying his relationship with an unnamed individual he was trading with. 
In fact, Hussain was actually spending thousands on digital currency and the individual, known as Person A, was later discovered to have conducted transactions worth £4,000 with Hussain.
These discrepancies were missed during the police vetting process during which an officer’s financial investments are scrutinized to determine their risk of vulnerability to financial inducement.

His secret crypto lifestyle was unearthed after Santander Bank closed his account and the police caught wind of what happened when dealing with his salary. 
Chief Constable Rob Nixon said Hussain knew his crypto trading would have affected his application and “he has maintained the lie in order to cover up his previous activity and relationship with Person A.”
Despite Hussain being barred from the police, Nixon noted that he would have been dismissed without notice had he still been serving.
“His conduct was fundamentally dishonest, demonstrated a serious lack of integrity, was continued, and would seriously undermine public confidence in policing,” said Nixon.

Massive Ethereum Transfer Shakes Crypto Market,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 22:01:05.575374,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Massive Ethereum Transfer Shakes Crypto Market
Bitcoin and altcoin markets are undoubtedly filled with new and exciting developments each day. Recently, a 9% increase in the price of ETH and a subsequent $100 million Ethereum transfer have caused significant turmoil in the market. These types of events often lead to major debates and speculations within the crypto community, and this time is no different.
Massive Ethereum Transfer Causes Alarm
Firstly, this massive Ethereum transfer was made to Binance and was revealed by Whale Alert data. However, the source of this transfer remains undisclosed, surrounded by many questions. The amount transferred, 26,889 ETH, is valued at $102.18 million.

The move is particularly notable as it occurred when Ethereum’s price reached its highest level since January 2022. This situation is often interpreted as a major investor’s move to sell assets. However, the actual reasons behind it are still unclear.
Can Ethereum Reach a New All-Time High?
ETH‘s 9% increase last week was overshadowed by Bitcoin‘s remarkable rise. However, Ethereum’s current value is above $3,800, still below its all-time high of $4,868. The question of whether Ethereum can surpass this historic price ceiling is one of the most debated topics in the crypto world right now.
Large investors transferring such significant amounts of Ethereum to Binance usually have profound effects on the market, and the direction of these effects can vary depending on the investors’ intentions. While large transfers to exchanges are often seen as indicators of impending sales, withdrawals can signal expectations of a rise. However, in this case, the transfer, parallel to Ethereum’s price, has led to more speculation about what investors are thinking.
Crypto markets are becoming more volatile each day, and such large-scale transactions can often provide clues about upcoming market movements or be a significant indicator for an asset. Predicting the direction in which a single transaction or event will move the entire market is not always possible, of course. As of writing this article, Ethereum is trading at $3,807.

Hong Kong to pilot wholesale CBDC sandbox for tokenized deposits,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 21:01:09.232521,"The Hong Kong regulator announced the creation of a sandbox for wholesale central bank digital currency.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has unveiled the Project Ensemble program, which involves the creation of a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) sandbox. The wCBDC is a digital payment instrument used by financial counterparties and acts as a reserve for the central bank. 
The project aims to study the “innovative financial market infrastructure” that contributes to the development of seamless interbank settlement in tokenized means of payment. Initially, the focus will be on the deposit component.
The Hong Kong government has been officially studying wCBDC since 2021. The HKMA has already held two market consultations on issuing a local digital dollar, the e-HKD. However, regulators have yet to decide on a possible date for introducing the new means of payment.

“Project Ensemble forms a key part of the HKMA’s broader portfolio of initiatives to facilitate the development of the tokenization market, comprising e-HKD and collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Center such as mBridge, Dynamo, and Genesis.” Statement via HKMA

The HKMA notes that the new program will create a wCBDC architecture community that includes representatives of public and private organizations. The governing body hopes the efforts will lead to an updated financial market infrastructure that bridges the gap between tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and transaction money.
Last week, a sandbox project was also presented in Hong Kong, allowing institutions to test the issuance of stablecoins. The initiative will test the issuance process, business model, investor protection, and risk management systems of stablecoins.

Bonk Crypto Price Prediction – $SMOG & $SPONGEV2 Emerges As Top Meme Coins Alongside $BONK,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 21:01:10.691892,"On March 5th, $BONK reached its all-time high, hitting $0.0000470, marking an impressive 184% increase over the last month. Given this remarkable surge, there is speculation that Bonk might experience a pullback, as it is currently down by 10% in the last 24 hours.
At present, the market sentiment is bullish, indicated by the Fear & Greed Index at 82 (Extreme Greed). However, it’s important to note that such periods of extreme greed are usually short-lived, implying a potentially limited timeframe for sustained bullish momentum.
Bonk has reached a noteworthy milestone by entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, signaling a significant achievement in its development. This impressive progress not only demonstrates the growing acceptance of $BONK but also indicates the changing trends within the crypto sphere.
The recent surge serves as a testament to the community’s confidence and the intrinsic value attributed to Bonk. This article will delve deeper into $BONK’s potential future trajectory and highlight two new meme coins with growth potential of 10x or more.

$BONK Crypto Price Prediction
As of the latest update, the price of Bonk stands at $0.0000291, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $549.90 million and a market capitalization of $1.90 billion. Over the past seven days, the price of $BONK has surged by more than 16%.
While the upward trend in Bonk’s price appears promising, there remains the potential for market corrections. Should it manage to surpass its nearest resistance level at $0.00003509, the long-term outlook could be optimistic, potentially attracting increased investor interest.

However, despite current recommendations to buy, it’s crucial to consider the presence of second support levels at $0.0000401 and $0.00000434, indicating inherent risks associated with Bonk.
It’s important to acknowledge that short-term fluctuations may occur, even amidst its newfound popularity, potentially driving its value towards these lower thresholds.

Multi-Chain Smog Surges 328% – Analysts Recommend it as the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now
In the midst of Bonk’s surge, the cryptocurrency community is abuzz with the rapid rise of Smog (SMOG), a new contender that has gained attention with its remarkable 328% surge in the last seven days, reaching an all-time high of $0.310.
Smog sets itself apart by opting for a fair launch model, devoid of any presale, ensuring an equal playing field for all participants. Its distribution strategy centers around airdrops and community incentives.
Entering the market strategically during the meme coin frenzy, Smog leverages the Solana blockchain to attract investors. It further distinguishes itself by prioritizing airdrop campaigns over presales, fostering a strong and engaged community—a critical factor for sustained success.
Launched in early February, $SMOG features innovative tokenomics geared towards incentivizing holders. Notably, 50% of the total supply is allocated for marketing campaigns, while 35% is reserved for airdrop rewards. Currently, Smog is running what it claims to be ‘the Greatest Airdrop in History.’

There are two ways to qualify for the biggest giveaway. The first entails acquiring and holding $SMOG, while the inventive Zealy campaign offers extra chances to earn airdrop points through specified tasks, like interacting with the project on social media platforms and visiting designated web pages.
With a fully diluted market cap of $401 million, $SMOG is carving out a niche in the meme coin sector. At the time of writing, Smog’s price is $0.282, reflecting a 50.91% increase in the last 24 hours. The momentum behind Smog remains strong, with over 63K holders and $13 million in trading volume within the past 24 hours.
The Smog website offers a 10% discount for over-the-counter purchases, alongside attractive staking rewards, boasting an annual yield of 42%, with over 19 million $SMOG tokens already locked up.
With Smog gaining traction on social media and expanding its integration with Ethereum, the token appears well-positioned for sustained growth and adoption.
Sponge V2 – Another Potential Gem in the Meme Coin Rally
Another meme coin worth keeping an eye on is Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2), the successor to the original $SPONGE meme coin launched in 2023, which delivered a 100x return. For investors who missed out on last year’s opportunity, the launch of the latest version of the meme coin offers a second chance.
With $SPONGE’s entry into the memecoin rally, the team is aiming for top-tier listings for $SPONGEV2, potentially sparking increased demand and price, attracting new investors, and ensuring sustained growth. Building on the legacy of Sponge V1, Sponge V2 introduces enhanced features and added value for token holders.
Notably, the inclusion of staking provides an avenue for earning passive rewards. Existing Sponge V1 holders can stake their $SPONGE to earn Sponge V2 tokens. For those without SPONGE tokens, they can purchase them on the Sponge V2 official website, where over $22 million in total staked and bridged assets have already been recorded.

In the paid version, players will use $SPONGEV2 tokens as credits for in-game assets and activities, with the chance to win rewards paid in the meme coin. This expansion into the blockchain gaming sector not only broadens the coin’s utility but also enhances its appeal.
With regard to $SPONGE, there may still be room for price growth given its current price and market cap. To acquire $SPONGEV2 token visit spongetoken.vip.

SEC Boss Issues Major Bitcoin Warning,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 21:01:14.809633,"

  Cover image via U.Today


During a recent interview with Bloomberg, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler pointed to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, cautioning investors about the inherent risks. 
""This is a highly speculative asset class,"" Gensler said, emphasizing the dramatic price fluctuations experienced by these digital assets. 
The conversation also touched on the topic of cryptocurrency regulations. 
Navigating the waves of crypto volatility
Gensler's warnings come amid growing concerns over the stability of investments in cryptocurrencies after they experienced a rollercoaster ride.   
""One could just look at the volatility of Bitcoin in the last few days,"" he pointed out, arguing that the thrill of investing in these markets might not be for everyone, especially those averse to high-risk financial rides. 
He further noted the foundational issues underlying these digital assets, questioning, ""How firm is the foundation of that? You know, you get to the top of that hill. How is the foundation underneath it?""
Gensler's cautious stance 
On the topic of crypto regulations, Gensler remained cautious. He spoke about the complex nature of determining whether digital assets like Ether are securities or commodities. 
As reported by U.Today, Gensler has repeatedly dodged questions about Ethereum's regulatory status.
He once again stressed that the SEC's approach depends on ""the facts and circumstances as to whether the investing public is anticipating a profit based on the efforts of others.""","['SEC', 'BTC', 'GARY']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea065c28248d6e30663b30/

Can Pepe (PEPE) Truly Give Investors the Gains They Want?
Too many people have made the mistake of not taking Pepe (PEPE) seriously. Many people have lost their chance to join Pepe (PEPE) at the start because they are not big pushers of meme coins. As of writing, Pepe (PEPE) has shut down cynics with a 135% value spike in just seven days.
Analysts are observing to see how long this trend will continue for Pepe (PEPE). Still, this considerable value spike of Pepe (PEPE) may play second fiddle to Raffle Coin (RAFF) soon. Raffle Coin (RAFF) has more going for it in terms of a profitable ecosystem than Pepe (PEPE).

The Raffle Coin (RAFF) platform has a lot of potential for great things. This is not just another decentralized platform; anyone who creates an account can see that. The Raffle Coin (RAFF) platform users are given many chances to win big thanks to the profit-focused platform and its benefits.

Hong Kong launches Project Ensemble to support tokenization with wCBDC,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 21:01:21.006317,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will launch a project to create a new wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) to support tokenization. Dubbed Project Ensemble, it could result in the issuance of a “live” CBDC if there is sufficient interest, the HKMA said in an announcement.
The project will center around innovative infrastructure for interbank settlement using wCBDC. Its initial focus will be on tokenized deposits, that is, tokenized commercial bank money, for use in transactions with tokenized assets. The first step in the project will be the creation of a sandbox that will research and test:

 “Tokenisation use cases that include, among others, settlement of tokenised real world assets (e.g. green bonds, carbon credits, aircraft, electric vehicle charging stations, electronic bills of lading and treasury management).”

The HKMA will also form a wCBDC Architecture Community that will consist of local and multinational banks, “key players,” and the HKMA’s CBDC Expert Group, which was formed in October and consists of 11 academics from a variety of fields and universities in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA will seek participation from other central banks and international organizations.

“We welcome global talents and industry players to come to Hong Kong and be part of this very exciting tokenisation journey,” HKMA chief executive said.

The announcement did not indicate any involvement by the Bank for International Settlements, although it mentioned the BIS projects the HKMA is already participating in, such as Projects mBridge, Dynamo and Genesis, and experiments it has conducted with local and Chinese banks. Those include tests conducted in conjunction with HSBC and Hang Seng that were conducted using the bank’s e-HKD “in house” CBDC. HSBC and Ant Group took part in another project that looked at the use of tokenized deposits to transfer funds within the HSBC network.
The HKMA released guidance in February on the sale and distribution of tokenized products that are not regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. The latter body is currently considering a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

Bitcoin is booming in Egypt and becoming a safe haven against currency devaluation!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 21:01:25.134163,"Actuellement, le prix du bitcoin (BTC) sur le marché est de l’ordre de 67 180 dollars. En Égypte, ce même bitcoin a augmenté d’un million de livres égyptiennes. La valorisation de la crypto phare au pays des pharaons a récemment explosé alors que la devise locale a subi une dévaluation substantielle dans un contexte économique difficile.
Le bitcoin s’envole, porté par une dévaluation de la livre égyptienne
Selon des informations récentes, la valorisation du bitcoin a récemment connu une forte augmentation en Égypte. Le prix de la crypto phare dans ce pays s’est accru de 1,3 million de livres égyptiennes.




C’est à tout le moins, une hausse spectaculaire. Cette dernière survient dans un contexte où la monnaie nationale du pays a subi une dépréciation importante. Une perte de valeur dépassant les 34 %, rien qu’au cours des deux derniers jours.
Autrement dit, la valeur du bitcoin a significativement augmenté par rapport à la livre égyptienne. Ceci signifie que les détenteurs égyptiens de la crypto phare ont assisté à l’explosion de la valeur de leurs bitcoins.
Ce qui se passe avec le bitcoin dans le contexte monétaire égyptien actuel démontre une chose. À savoir que le bitcoin sert effectivement de bouclier contre les risques financiers comme la dépréciation monétaire et les conséquences qui en découlent. Parmi celles-ci, la perte de pouvoir d’achat et l’inflation galopante.

La valeur du bitcoin explose en Égypte, augmentant de 1,3 million de livres, tandis que la monnaie locale plonge


L’avantage à détenir du bitcoin
Hunter Horsley, le PDG de Bitwise, s’est exprimé sur la situation économique de l’Égypte et le rôle que peut jouer la crypto phare. Il soutient que détenir du bitcoin est financièrement avantageux, notamment en temps de crise. Ce qui explique son attrait croissant en tant que réserve de valeur.
Ainsi, dans le contexte des bouleversements économiques que connaît l’Égypte, le PDG de Bitwise souligne le rôle du bitcoin en tant qu’instrument de couverture financière. Un rôle qui pourrait davantage s’accentuer sachant que les Égyptiens ne sont pas encore sortis de l’ornière.
Récemment, leur pays a obtenu un prêt de 8 milliards de dollars du Fonds monétaire international (FMI). Seulement, cela ne garantit en rien une amélioration immédiate de la situation économique de l’Égypte. 
L’Etat travaille activement à stabiliser son économie tout en tentant d’attirer des investissements étrangers pour éviter une nouvelle dépréciation de sa monnaie. En attendant, le bitcoin semble se positionner comme le rempart idéal face à la crise que subissent les Égyptiens.

"Apart From XRP, ADA, and ATOM, These Altcoins Hold the Potential for a 100x Rally This Cycle",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-07 21:01:27.984501,"The post Apart From XRP, ADA, and ATOM, These Altcoins Hold the Potential for a 100x Rally This Cycle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The crypto markets appear to have entered the initial phase of the 2024 bull run and could have probably headed toward its end. With this, a strong bullish wave is expected to flow into the space, which may cause the prices of the majority of the tokens to pierce through their previous ATH. 
Recently, the Bitcoin (BTC) price smashed a new ATH at $69,170 and hence, it becomes more feasible to consider whether it is a good time to enter as the star crypto has already made a strong move. 
Although the cycle is just beginning, the altcoins haven’t even started to surge yet, while the BTC price is still very far from its higher targets. In the middle of the soaring bullish sentiments, some altcoins are possessing the huge potential to be the next 100x gem. In the upcoming cycle, four major sectors may thrive, namely, AI, GameFi, Layer-2, and Memecoins. Below are some of the tokens that need one’s attention. 

enqAI (enqAI), formerly known as noiseGPT, stands for uncensored and unbiased AI. With a small market cap of $110.49 million, the token has more room to grow.


Jito Network (JTO), supports the Solana ecosystem with its JitoSOL liquid staking pool and different products with a micro market cap of around $342 million


Chain GPT (CGPT) is an advanced AI infrastructure that develops AI-powered technologies for the Web3, blockchain, and crypto spaces. Market Cap: ~ $156 million


Starknet (STRK), a zk-Rollup that functions as L2, allows the dApps to scale with a market cap of over a billion


Celestia (TIA), a modular blockchain, simplifies the blockchain launching process, allowing enhanced scalability. The market cap of TIA is nearly $2.6 billion


Heros of Mavia (MAVIA) is a Web3 MMO strategy game with a market cap of around $191 million


Milady Meme Coin (LADYS) is a growing memecoin with a market cap of just $84 million


SatoshiVM (SAVM) is a Bitcoin ZK rollup L2 that uses BTC for gas fees. Mainnet is expected to launch soon. 

The stages of the bull market are pretty clear, where the traders pour huge liquidity onto Bitcoin first, which in turn escalates to Ethereum. Further high-cap altcoins surged, followed by the low-cap tokens. The first stage of the cycle appears to have passed and hence the altcoins are expected to expand as the liquidity has already entered the high-cap tokens. 
The current market dynamics suggest the new altcoins are growing better than the older ones and therefore, the above-mentioned tokens can be considered for the upcoming bull run. ","['RLY', '2024', '2024', 'LADYS', 'JTO']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ea0414b8024d06250b184d/

Worldcoin Gets the Boot Again: Will WLD’s Price Feel the Heat?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-07 21:01:31.026401,"
WLD’s price dropped to $7.35 after Spain revealed that it had placed a ban on the project.
The bulls were defending the $6.71 support and targeting a close above $8.
Though the EMAs indicated a bearish trend, WLD might rebound because of the trending AI narrative.

An hour after Spain revealed that it wanted Worldcoin (WLD) out of the country, the price of the cryptocurrency fell. At press time, WLD had increased by 9% in the last 24 hours. But the development which appeared on March 7, stopped the token from hitting $8 as the price dropped to $7.35.
According to Spain’s data protection authority, Worldcoin has not proven enough to show that user data was protected. For the unfamiliar, Spain is a big market for Worldcoin as over 360,000 users have had their biometrics taken while obtaining WLD tokens in return.
With the development, it might be difficult for the project to amass users in Europe. Previously, France and Germany had allayed concerns about the mission of the project. Countries like Kenya and Korea have also been investigating the firm.

UNI in particular is known for its large price fluctuations lately. The decentralized exchange plans to distribute some of the transaction fees to wallet holders holding UNI. After the announcement of this plan, there was a huge increase in the price of the altcoin.
However, Coinbase does not normally offer futures services due to strict rules within the US borders, but the exchange had recently established the international Coinbase International platform and started offering futures services there.

With that in mind, investors should explore the potential of Meme Kombat.
The project team and its community have successfully conducted a remarkable presale offering, with millions of dollars committed.

New and Best Meme Coins to Buy Now

The crypto market has deviated from its usual trajectory in recent developments, experiencing a downturn over the past two days. Following brief explosive gains that propelled the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high value of $69,000, it subsequently underwent a significant pullback.
This event led to a substantial decline in crypto prices and liquidated over 750 million across the board. The impact of the price decline has extended to altcoins, with meme coins also being affected. At present, analysts express uncertainty regarding the potential trajectory of this trend.

Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Plummets 14% As Experts Say This New Green ICO Might Be The Best Crypto To Buy Now,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 21:01:36.157320,"
The Shiba Inu price has plunged 14% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.00003198 as of 7 a.m. EST on a 60% drop in trading volume to $4.7 billion.
SHIB’s fall comes amid a broad selloff in the meme coin sector after a surging rally fired by Bitcoin’s pump to a new all-time high.
The Shiba Inu Price: Buyers Gearing Up For Another Bull Rally?


SHIBUSDT Analysis By Tradingview
The Shiba Inu price indicates a gradual uptrend after experiencing an extended period of consolidation. During this time, a support zone was formed at $0.00001030, which aided the bulls in driving the price upwards.
Yet, the bulls encountered resistance when the price reached the $0.00004512 level, resulting in pressure from the bears, pushing the price down to $0.00002853. This formation has created a bullish pennant, indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.
The bulls have shown resilience, rebounding twice as they gather forces on the $0.00002853 support level to initiate a bull rally above the bullish pennant.
The price trades above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which currently support the price. The moving average cross at $0.00001040 affirms the generally bullish outlook for Shiba Inu price.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates a downtrend as it consolidates on the 50 midline level. A rebound from this level could see the RSI surge back to the overbought region, indicating intense buying pressure for the Shiba Inu price.
The Shiba Inu Price Bulls Target $0.00006288 Mark Above The Pennant
Shiba Inu price is a bullish bias as the bulls aim to push the price to the $0.00006288 mark. The support zone at $0.00002863 and the golden cross at $0.00001040 support further upside potential. If the momentum sustains strongly, a breach above this level could see SHIB reach a new all-time high in the upcoming weeks.
Conversely, the RSI  being in the overbought region could trigger a potential price correction. This might encourage the bears to take control and drive the price down, forcing the bulls to retreat to the $0.00001216 support zone.
As Shiba Inu traders await favourable new entry positions, some investors are being drawn to the new eTukTuk token, which is opening doors to a greener future in transportation with its $TUK token presale.

As Bitcoin continues to resist downward pressures, maintaining its value above the $66,000 threshold, observers have noted the cryptocurrency‘s resilience. Despite experiencing a considerable dip from its peak price, Bitcoin has showcased a robust defense against bearish trends, likely due to solid fundamentals and heightened attention from institutional investors.
Bitcoin’s Tenacity Attracts Major Players
The entry of heavyweight financial entities, such as BlackRock, has been a noteworthy development, bolstering Bitcoin’s stance. Investment vehicles like the iShares Bitcoin Trust are paving the way for these institutions to engage with Bitcoin, solidifying its market position.
Cryptocurrency analysts highlight BlackRock’s increasing Bitcoin holdings as evidence of sustained institutional appetite. This enduring interest, coupled with predictions by figures like Michael Novogratz who foresees Bitcoin hitting $100,000, is fueling optimistic market sentiments for the cryptocurrency’s future valuation.
Surge of Institutional Capital into Bitcoin
Data reveals that BlackRock’s Bitcoin assets have soared to 187,538 BTC. This trend underscores a growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Moreover, the rising engagements of other ETFs and funds with BTC signal an overall enhancement in Bitcoin’s appeal to investors.
While Bitcoin’s prominence endures, some market participants suggest a pivot towards altcoins, which are gaining traction through decentralized finance initiatives and novel crypto ventures. Despite the allure of these emerging tokens, Bitcoin remains a central focus, with many anticipating its value to increase substantially.
Rising Expectations for Bitcoin’s Value
Predictions for Bitcoin’s future worth remain varied, with estimates ranging from $80,000 to an ambitious $1 million. These projections reflect the cryptocurrency’s potential and the market’s expectation for its continued growth.
Currently, Bitcoin’s market activity signals a modest uptick, with its latest trade value at $67,300. This performance reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a trusted investment option. With both institutional and retail interest on the rise, the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory is anticipated to climb further, highlighted by its current trading price of $67,538.

 Recent market activity has showcased a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency domain, with Render Network (RNDR) achieving a record value. The surge in Render’s price, reaching $10.30, is seen in the context of heightened interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-themed cryptocurrencies, coinciding with significant events like an AI conference and a high-profile lawsuit involving Elon Musk. 
Market Enthusiasm Lifts AI-Themed Cryptocurrency
 The rise of Render Network comes amid broader excitement surrounding AI-related coins, which have been drawing increased attention from investors.

"Bitcoin Maintains Strong Resistance at $66,000 Level",COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 21:01:46.156357,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Bitcoin Maintains Strong Resistance at $66,000 Level
Described as the king of the cryptocurrency world, BTC stubbornly resists above the $66,000 mark. On Tuesday, it witnessed a double-digit drop from its all-time high. However, BTC maintained its resistance against the bears’ efforts to lower its price. This situation can be associated with Bitcoin‘s strong fundamentals and the growing interest of institutional investors.
Emphasis on $66,000 in Bitcoin Price Commentary
In particular, the entry into the market of massive financial institutions like BlackRock, through funds that facilitate access to Bitcoin such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust, stands out as a significant factor increasing BTC’s resistance.
The increase in Bitcoin assets held by BlackRock indicates that institutional demand remains strong and interest in BTC continues. As a result, it is not surprising that BTC maintains its resistance around the $66,000 levels. This also leads to increased expectations for Bitcoin’s price in 2024. For instance, Michael Novogratz, a prominent figure in the crypto world, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $100,000.
Influx of Institutional Investors into Bitcoin
According to financial analysts’ data, BlackRock’s total Bitcoin assets have reached 187,538 BTC. These figures show that the interest and confidence of institutional investors in Bitcoin are steadily increasing. Moreover, the interest of other ETFs and funds in BTC is also seen to be increasing. For example, according to data provided by Farside, the “Nine” ETF has transferred significant resources into Bitcoin, which continues to increase BTC’s value.
Despite this steady increase in Bitcoin’s price, some think it’s time to shift from BTC, now called “King Crypto,” to altcoins. In particular, with the increasing interest in decentralized finance protocols and other next-generation crypto projects, many investors are turning to alternative cryptocurrencies in addition to BTC.
BTC Predictions Keep Coming
Along with the rise of these alternative cryptocurrencies, many analysts continue to predict that Bitcoin’s price will also increase. Many forecast that BTC could reach a value between $80,000 and $1 million going forward. This highlights Bitcoin’s potential and long-term growth expectations.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s 24-hour chart shows a 0.95% increase, trading at $67,300, indicating that activity in the cryptocurrency world continues and that BTC is still considered a reliable asset among investors. In the coming days, with the growing interest of institutional and individual investors in Bitcoin, the price of BTC is likely to rise even further.

Altseason is coming — Or at least data suggests that it’s close,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 21:01:48.711655,"Bitcoin (BTC) price witnessed a sharp correction shortly after hitting a new all-time high at $69,324 on March 5
Meanwhile, altcoins, led by memecoins and AI-themed cryptocurrencies, have outperformed BTC over the last week, initiating a debate on whether the altcoin season (altseason) is here.

Total crypto market capitalization hits $2.5 trillion
Bitcoin’s brief escapade above $69,000 on March 5 saw the global crypto market value cross the $2.5 trillion mark, reflecting the current bullish momentum. At the time of publishing, this figure stands at $2.52 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Altcoins displayed similar strength, with their total market capitalization (see chart below) rising above $1.1 trillion on the same day. This metric measures the total market value of all crypto assets except Bitcoin.

Over the last three months, this value has rallied approximately 64% from $697 billion to $1.14 trillion on March 7. This is a slightly better performance than the 56% posted by Bitcoin over the same period.
This ascent attests to growing investor interest in altcoins and the amazing performance recently displayed by this class of crypto assets.
Large-cap altcoins outperform Bitcoin
The tremendous rally displayed by memecoins and AI over the last week could be a sign that the market is at the start of the altseason. 
Data from CoinMarketCap shows memecoins posting double and triple-digit gains within the last seven days.
In particular, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), posted 20% and 130% gains this week, respectively. Newer tokens such as Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF) saw double to triple-digit gains during the same period.

Other notable performances came from tokens within the AI ecosystem led by Fetch.ai (FET), Synesis One (SNS), SingularityNET (AGIX) and Theta Network (THETA), which also produced double to triple-digit gains in 7 days.
Bitcoin has only risen 8.5% over the same period. 
It’s not altseason, yet
The performance of the altcoins seemingly coincides with an improvement in the altcoin season index, indicating that the altcoin season is close. According to this index by Blockchain Center: 

 “If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.”

This indicator essentially demonstrates that only 69% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days. Although this index has increased over the last few days, it is still insufficient to declare an altcoin season.
However, according to a recent market report by K33 Research, this could change soon. The report noted that Bitcoin’s rally toward its new all-time high saw its market cap double relative to the value of all cryptocurrencies except BTC and Ether (ETH) since the bottom of November 2022.

The K33 Research analysts said the setup mirrors the 2020 altcoin bull run just before they caught up with Bitcoin’s uptrend. 

 “Judging by history, altcoins will start outperforming about the time we are now.”

Independent analyst CrediBULL dives into the connection between Bitcoin’s performance at the start of the altseason. In a March 4 post in X, CrediBULL outlines two possible scenarios: 
A mega breakout when Bitcoin breaks its prior ATH and quickly doubles in a matter of weeks, and “alts don't get much love until BTC pauses after this breakout leg,” and a consolidation scenario where Bitcoin revisits its prior ATH but faces rejection or consolidates at the highs for a few weeks. In the latter case, altcoins “start rallying almost immediately after BTC tags prior to ATH. ”
CrediBull says,

 “The common theme here and the key takeaway is that after BTC hits prior ATH, alts begin rallying at the first major pause/consolidation of BTC, whether that at prior ATH or far above it.”

However, founder and CEO of MN Trading Consultancy Michaël van de Poppe believes that the altcoin season is yet to kick in, pointing out that they still have “40-60% market capitalization” before it reaches the 2021 highs above $1.1 trillion.

On his part, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes that the altcoin season will start once DOGE overtakes ADA in market capitalization. In a March 5 post on X social media platform, Hoskinson said,

 “That moment DOGE flips Cardano. It’s officially alt-season kids.”

Identifying the next ample opportunity within cryptocurrency can be similar to finding a needle in a haystack. As the hunger surrounding cryptos and other digital assets continues to grow, investors are looking for projects that offer both innovation and the potential for substantial returns. 
In this article, we discuss the two notable cryptocurrencies, Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Dogecoin (DOGE), before turning our attention towards BlockDAG (BDAG). This new crypto altcoin sensation promises to turn the market upside down. 
Floki Inu’s Burn Plan Announcement 
Floki Inu (FLOKI) has captured significant attention within the cryptocurrency market following an impressive surge in price over a short period. With a rise of over 50% in just 24 hours and an astonishing 336% increase over the last week, Floki Inu has made a name for itself as a formidable player in the craze surrounding meme coins. 




The proposal to burn tokens saw nearly 90% of FLOKI holders vote in favour, resulting in the deletion of tokens worth $27.5 million at current market rates. Supporters view this burn as crucial in strengthening Floki Inu’s long-term expectations and invoking confidence in the project’s future growth. 
Dogecoin (DOGE): Surging Amid Speculations
Dogecoin has surged over 20%, nearing the significant $0.17 mark. This surge has been notable due to substantial movements by important holders, commonly called whales. These movements have sparked discussions and increased investor interest, creating new excitement for this meme coin. The speculation surrounding a potential Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launch is exciting as it has further invoked optimism among enthusiasts. 




Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, has sparked optimism by suggesting a more than 30% chance of a Dogecoin ETF launch, aligning with broader market expectations of Dogecoin’s mainstream adoption. Investors speculate about Dogecoin reaching the $0.2 mark, with experts predicting a price rally. Dogecoin continues to attract global investor interest, merging humor with prospects of significant returns. 
BlockDAG – Where Swift Transactions Meet Solid Security
Amidst the excitement within the cryptocurrency industry due to these meme coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands tall by distinguishing itself through the innovative utilisation of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology and the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. BlockDAG Coin has redefined cryptocurrency mining, as investors and miners interested in innovation will find BlockDAG’s innovative approach highly appealing. 
With the potential for early investors to earn 5000x returns upon its official launch, BlockDAG has been regarded as a lucrative investment opportunity poised to deliver its promises of passive returns. This potential is further heightened by the diverse income streams offered by BlockDAG, ranging from coin investment strategy to mobile mining convenience and dedicated mining units. 


With a clear roadmap that includes raising $600 million until the end of the year (having already made $3 in batch 2nd presale) and the confidence of the team behind BlockDAG, investors are presented with an intriguing opportunity to take advantage of the project’s growth and potential market dominance. 
BlockDAG also sets itself apart in the cryptosphere by focusing on environmental sustainability. This focus on environmental responsibility also positions BlockDAG as a forward-thinking and socially responsible investment in the cryptocurrency market.
The Last Say 
While Floki Inu and Dogecoin continue to capture headlines with their price surges and community support, BlockDAG stands out as a revolutionary force in the crypto space. With its innovative approach, commitment to sustainability, and lucrative investment opportunities, BDAG offers new and experienced investors a captivating opportunity. 




As the crypto market continues its unpredictable run, the new network’s emphasis on accessibility, efficiency, and environmental responsibility positions it as a potential player in shaping the future of digital assets. Take advantage of the opportunity to make financial freedom a reality with BlockDAG.

Bitcoin price has slightly recovered at the time of writing, and altcoins continue to perform positively. Coinbase is making its presence known in futures markets with its global exchange. Coinbase had launched its own Global exchange to diversify revenue streams and expand globally.
Coinbase Listing Announcement
According to an announcement made by the exchange today, if liquidity conditions are met, three cryptocurrencies will be listed. The pairs to be opened are BLUR-PERP, SEI-PERP, and UNI-PERP, but for now, this news has not had much impact on their prices. Looking on the bright side, this trio has another reason to rise on March 14th. Moreover, in bull markets, such minor details can trigger parabolic rallies.

Finally, the increased capital inflow into these altcoins, which will have more liquidity, is a possibility that should not be overlooked. Investors should consider the potential for volatility on the day of the listing. Currently, the ETF channel is strong in volume, and with BTC aiming for $68,000 again, optimism prevails in the altcoin market.

As investors scout for undervalued assets with promising trajectories, these tokens offer a compelling proposition, inviting adventurous souls to capitalize on emerging trends and unlock the allure of substantial returns in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.
Ripple (XRP) Poised for Potential: A Compelling Investment Option on the Verge of $1
Ripple (XRP) presents a compelling investment option within the cryptocurrency market, currently priced around $0.62 and exhibiting a steady 5% increase over the past week. As the broader market experiences a bullish rally, XRP stands poised to capitalize on the momentum and potentially surpass the $1 mark in the near future.
One of the key factors contributing to XRP’s attractiveness as an investment option is its robust technology and widespread adoption within the financial sector.

With partnerships established with major financial institutions worldwide, Ripple has positioned itself as a frontrunner in facilitating seamless and instant global transactions.

With the anticipation of surpassing the $1 threshold looming, XRP presents an attractive opportunity for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios and capitalize on the continued evolution of the cryptocurrency market.


Dogecoin (DOGE): A Compelling Investment with Potential Upside in the Cryptocurrency Market
Dogecoin (DOGE) emerges as an intriguing investment option within the cryptocurrency sphere, currently trading around $0.15 and experiencing a notable 20% increase in value over the past week. While Dogecoin may not be poised to surpass the $1 mark in the immediate future, its susceptibility to upward movement, as indicated by market analysis, positions it as a compelling asset for investors seeking potential gains.
One of the key factors contributing to Dogecoin’s appeal is its widespread popularity and strong community backing. Originally created as a lighthearted meme coin, DOGE has evolved into a significant player in the crypto space, with a dedicated following and active community engagement. This robust community support fosters a sense of solidarity and resilience, driving demand for Dogecoin and potentially fueling further price appreciation.
Moreover, Dogecoin’s accessibility and low barrier to entry make it an attractive option for novice investors looking to dip their toes into the world of cryptocurrency. With its simple and user-friendly interface, Dogecoin appeals to a broad demographic, further expanding its reach and market potential.
As Dogecoin continues to ride the waves of market sentiment and speculation, its susceptibility to upward movement presents an opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on short-term gains and long-term potential.

In other news, Raffle Coin (RAFF) is taking the crypto world by storm as its presale announcement eclipses other events in the crypto community.
Stellar (XLM) Users Brace For Nosedive as The Bears Move In
Stellar (XLM) has recorded positive price movements in the past few weeks, which has done a lot to pacify investors. In light of recent events, analysts forecast a potential correction at hand. Stellar (XLM) recorded a 7-day increase of 9.2% and an increase in trade volume of 152%, signaling a potential rally to $1.
As it would seem, the decentralized protocol is nowhere near that milestone. Market analysts expect a retrace soon. Stellar (XLM) continues to provide decentralized services in a highly centralized financial market, underscoring its utility in the crypto industry. While currently underperforming, there is hope of a tide turn in Stellar (XLM) in the days ahead as the project inches towards $1.
Cardano (ADA) Founder Relieves Concerns On His Position With Project Midnight
In a rally of tweets between Cardano (ADA) community members and Charles Hoskinson, Cardano (ADA) founder on X, Charles reaffirms his position to stick with the community. Rumors have been flying in the community surrounding Charles Hoskinson’s plan to leave Cardano (ADA) for a privacy-based side chain called Midnight. 
In dealing with these rumors, Charles Hoskinson expresses his continuous support for the community he helped inspire and promises more improvements in Cardano (ADA).
Politically, Cardano (ADA) has been backing legislators who intend to challenge traditional financial systems trying to slow the advent of crypto technology. With more support from projects like Raffle Coin (RAFF), true decentralization could become a reality.
Raffle Coin (RAFF) Takes Centre Stage as Presale Event Kicks Off
Raffle Coin (RAFF) has enjoyed patronage from investors all over the crypto space in its recent presale phase. Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) investors are particularly interested in the project’s profitability potential in light of current market events.

Raffle Coin (RAFF) has 5 stages of its presale left and its first stage lists a RAFF token at $0.016. If this trajectory remains constant, Raffle Coin (RAFF) is well positioned for massive gains and investors stand to benefit the most from its positive performance.

Another AI boom is arising, presenting massive opportunities for quick-witted traders to harness the trend.
Meme AI has been one of the best performers today, benefiting from the market’s appetite for AI and meme coins.
Scotty the AI is also gathering pace as it crosses the $3 million mark at presale. Will this be the next AI token to explode?
Meme AI Trends as Traders Eye Nvidia Conference
Meme Ai’s position at the intersection of the AI and meme coin markets has enabled it to soar this week.
An exponential AI market boom is expected as Nvidia prepares for its Game Developer Conference in March.
“AI tokens will pump even harder leading up to the Nvidia AI conference for developers on 18-22 March. Full send!” said analyst Crypto Coach on X.
Yet, with countless AI tokens to choose from, the market is favoring AI related meme projects, given the sector’s recent explosion. 
Meme coins offer a newbie-friendly narrative that all market participants can understand, presenting massive growth potential.
Commentator Crypto Koryo highlighted this in a recent tweet: “For those who are ignoring meme coins, let me remind you that in the 2021 bull market, memes were THE best-performing narrative of the year. Ranked three times as the number one narrative with average returns surpassing any other narrative that ranked number one.”


Meme coins have also exploded more recently, with Shiba Inu and Pepe up over 100% in the last seven days.
The confluence of these two sectors’ success is seemingly why Meme Ai is pumping. 
The project is up 126% today and 555% this week, placing it in the top three trending cryptos on CoinMarketCap.
Its 24-hour trading volume has also exploded, up 1,424% at $9.3 million.


Besides the ongoing AI and meme coin frenzy, another factor contributing to Meme AI’s hype is its compelling use case. 
The project invites users to create hilarious memes with its innovative AI tool and claims to be “transforming meme communities into marketing titans.”
The memes can then be minted into NFTs and traded on the project’s upcoming marketplace.
Meme AI’s buzz is also apparent within its community, which recently crossed the 2.7K follower mark on X and also boasts 2.7K Telegram members.
Another similar project witnessing success is Scotty the AI. It is currently in its presale, enabling investors to get in at the lowest price.
AI Meme Coin Scotty the AI Raises $3M and Offers 57% Staking APY
Also tapping into the prevalent AI trend, Scotty the AI is a loveable crossbreed of meme coin and AI security maverick.
After launching in mid-February, its presale has seen monumental success, raising over $3.3 million. Yet this is no surprise given its proximity to two of the industry’s most dominating trends.


Scotty the AI is based on an enigmatic Scottish Terrier with jet-black fur. As the project’s mascot, it is easy to get swept away by Scotty’s memetic allure.
However, behind the puppy dog eyes are advanced AI algorithms engineered to detect “patterns and anomalies that even the most skilled human programmers would miss.”
As a loyal blockchain companion, Scotty will catch malevolent actors and blockchain bandits, ensuring the industry is safe for everyone. 
His real-world application packaged in a playful meme coin offers mass market appeal, appeasing novice and experienced traders alike.
In a bid to ensure long-term success, Scotty the AI boasts a staking mechanism, currently offering a 57% APY. However, this will decrease as the staking pool grows, so potential investors should act fast.
As a further incentive to early adopters, those who buy today will enjoy the lowest price.
Currently available at $0.0078 on the official website, the Scotty the AI presale price will increase incrementally as the campaign advances, with the next uptick occurring in nine days.","['AI', 'MEMEAI', 'MM', 'MEMEAI', 'SHIB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9fd13b8024d06250b183d/
Elon Musk owns over $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin! According to Arkham,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 21:02:04.666530,"Les empires les mieux gardés ont leurs secrets percés à jour, et l’empire Musk n’y échappe pas. Dans une percée fracassante, la société d’investigation blockchain Arkham a mis au jour d’immenses réserves en Bitcoin détenues par Tesla et SpaceX. Dissimulées jusqu’à présent, ces crypto-richesses jettent une lumière crue sur la stratégie crypto d’Elon Musk, à la tête de ce véritable empire technologique.
La réserve secrète de Bitcoin mise à nu
Selon les révélations d’Arkham, Tesla détiendrait pas moins de 11 510 bitcoin, évalués à 780 millions de dollars. Quant à SpaceX, l’entreprise aéronautique cacherait 8 290 bitcoin, d’une valeur de 560 millions de dollars. Un véritable trésor crypto soigneusement enfoui par le fantasque milliardaire Elon Musk.




Cependant, ces chiffres mirobolants ne seraient qu’un pâle reflet du passé récent. En effet, des informations du Wall Street Journal indiquent que SpaceX aurait vendu une partie conséquente de ses réserves en 2022 et 2021, subissant une perte de 373 millions de dollars sur ses avoirs Bitcoin. Une décision controversée qui soulève des questions sur la vision crypto de Musk.
Les Ambitions Secrètes de Elon Musk  
Derrière ces réserves massives de Bitcoin se cacherait une stratégie bien plus vaste de la part d’Elon Musk. En effet, l’homme visionnaire semble avoir préparé son empire technologique à intégrer les cryptomonnaies dans ses opérations. Avec une anticipation et une vision à long terme caractéristiques, Musk aurait minutieusement positionné ses entreprises pour embrasser la révolution des cryptos et de la blockchain.
De Tesla à SpaceX, en passant par ses autres sociétés de pointe, Musk aurait patiemment constitué un trésor de guerre Bitcoin. Une manœuvre de grande envergure qui pourrait bien annoncer une adoption massive des cryptomonnaies au sein de son empire industriel.
L’Offensive Fracassante en Préparation ?
Ces révélations ne font qu’attiser les spéculations autour des véritables intentions d’Elon Musk concernant les cryptomonnaies. En effet, certains analystes estiment que ces avoirs massifs en Bitcoin ne servent qu’à constituer une réserve de valeur. Cette réserve pourrait protéger les actifs contre l’inflation, à l’image de l’or numérique. 
Cependant, les observateurs sont persuadés qu’avec ces réserves Bitcoin dissimulées, Musk pourrait avoir soigneusement préparé un coup. Il pourrait avoir lancé une cryptomonnaie propriétaire pour l’ensemble de ses sociétés de pointe. Ces révélations laissent à penser qu’une manœuvre fracassante se prépare dans l’ombre.
De l’utilisation du Bitcoin comme moyen de paiement à une éventuelle cryptomonnaie maison, les théories les plus folles sont désormais envisageables. Une chose est sûre, ces découvertes n’ont fait qu’entrouvrir la porte sur un pan jusqu’alors méconnu de l’empire d’Elon Musk. Nul doute que d’autres révélations fracassantes restent à venir.","['SIE', 'ARKM', 'SCRT', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9fd16e837342a9e18a1a1/
Nigeria’s Central Bank Partners Gluwa to Advance e-Naira Adoption,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 21:02:05.997572,"In a strategic move aimed at accelerating the adoption of its digital currency, the e-Naira, the Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) has forged a partnership with blockchain infrastructure firm Gluwa. 
As per the announcement, this collaboration heralds a new chapter in Nigeria’s journey towards embracing digital currencies and underscores the central bank’s commitment to innovation and financial inclusion.
Gluwa Introduces its Credal Technology to the e-Naira Ecosystem
Gluwa, known for its pioneering blockchain solutions, brings its expertise to the table with the introduction of its Credal technology to the e-Naira ecosystem. This technology, which powers loans on the real-world asset-oriented Creditcoin blockchain developed by Gluwa, holds the promise of revolutionizing the lending landscape within Nigeria’s digital currency framework.
By integrating Gluwa’s Credal technology into the e-Naira, Nigeria’s central bank aims to enhance the utility and accessibility of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Also, the partnership with Gluwa represents a strategic move to leverage blockchain innovation to address real-world financial needs, particularly in the realm of lending and credit.
Gluwa’s Credal technology offers a novel approach to lending, leveraging blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent lending processes. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, Gluwa seeks to democratize access to credit and empower individuals and businesses with greater financial autonomy.
Nigeria Central Bank Keen on Economic Empowerment
Interestingly, the integration of Credal technology into the e-Naira ecosystem holds the potential to unlock new opportunities for economic empowerment and financial inclusion in Nigeria. Through the facilitation of blockchain-based lending, individuals and businesses can access much-needed capital to fuel growth and innovation.
Furthermore, the partnership between Nigeria’s central bank and Gluwa underscores the importance of collaboration between traditional financial institutions and blockchain innovators in driving the adoption of digital currencies. By combining the regulatory oversight of the central bank with the technical expertise of blockchain firms like Gluwa, Nigeria can navigate the complexities of digital currency adoption more effectively.
Nigeria’s Plan for CBDC
Recall that the CBN took a step forward last year to encourage the use of e-Naira. In the past, there have been doubts about Nigeria’s CBDC success, nonetheless, the country has worked hard to introduce the eNaira after receiving authorization from the Federal High Court.
So far, the CBDC project has undergone several upgrades and integration to make it easier for Nigerians to navigate. In 2022, the use of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) on mobile phones for e-Naira transactions was introduced for users.

Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK and creator of Cardano, reassures investors amid uncertainty. Denying departure rumors on X, he reaffirms dedication to Cardano, stating, “The answer is no.” Midnight, IOG’s blockchain for data protection, won’t detract from the Cardano mission. 
Hoskinson emphasizes Cardano’s aim of providing economic identity through decentralized applications. This underscores his continued commitment to Cardano’s growth and development in the blockchain space.
Elsewhere, Chainlink (LINK) plummets 2.95%. The LINK token has tried recovering a lot of its prowess following the general March 5 dump but it remains in the negatives. Analysts do not believe Chainlink (LINK) possesses enough support to break into the $30 region anytime soon and new investors are growing tired of the Chainlink (LINK) pace within a bull season.
Where Does Binance Coin (BNB) Go From Here?
Binance Coin (BNB) has surged over 39.52% in the past month, hitting $421.98, its highest since April 2022. Despite recent legal challenges, BNB’s rally signals renewed confidence, buoyed by settlements and management changes. 
Binance Coin (BNB) remains a top choice for established investors, but what of new and intermediate investors? The wager that Binance Coin (BNB) offers cannot be compared to Raffle Coin (RAFF). Only one of the two is projected to grow by 100x in six months.

Market Frenzy: Raffle Coin (RAFF) Attracts Avalanche (AVAX) and Litecoin (LTC) Enthusiasts in Spectacular First Week,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 21:02:11.045264,"In the current market frenzy, investors are keen on innovative projects that can extend profits. Among the myriad of options available, Avalanche (AVAX) and Litecoin (LTC) stand out as promising contenders, each offering unique features and opportunities.
Meanwhile, Raffle Coin (RAFF) introduces a fresh utility approach, leveraging blockchain technology. As these projects continue to gain traction in the crypto space, investors are eager to uncover their potential and seize the opportunities they present.
Avalanche (AVAX) Seems Unresponsive to the Bull Movement
Avalanche (AVAX) has witnessed significant growth mirroring the broader layer 1 market. In December 2023, Avalanche (AVAX) surged by over 120%, prompting further investments and on-chain activity. Avalanche (AVAX) has accrued 17.10% in the last month and 0.56% in the last seven days. 
This trend has left Avalanche (AVAX) investors skeptical of its token’s progress within the ongoing rally. As of press timing, an AVAX token hovers around $40.09. After Bitcoin (BTC) attained its new ATH, various altcoins experienced a dip. 
While most have quickly recovered, Avalanche (AVAX) has struggled with an up-and-down movement. Avalanche’s technological advancements and ecosystem strength position it for continued growth in the near term. However, as with any investment, prudent research and risk assessment are crucial.
Litecoin (LTC) Drops in Market Cap Ranks
Litecoin (LTC) has rallied impressively, soaring over 43% from $66.75 to $75 in February. In the last seven days, prices surged by 11.57%. Notably, while market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) faced declines, Litecoin (LTC) did too. However, the LTC token has resumed its bullish momentum.
After the breakout, Litecoin (LTC) entered a sideways channel with support around $60 and resistance near $70. This consolidation phase reflects market indecision and the potential for further Litecoin (LTC) movement. But with little to no assurance, Litecoin (LTC) investors are taking their gains and extending their portfolios. One of the bigger names on their lists is Raffle Coin (RAFF).
The Latest Market Frenzy: Raffle Coin (RAFF)

Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world are in a phase where optimism for continued growth persists. We have even started to receive news of all-time high records being set by some cryptocurrency units. Today, an altcoin set an all-time record. The price of the altcoin Render reached its highest level ever. Moreover, this increase was not hindered by a profit-taking of 31.65 million dollars.
Render Network Breaks Record
Altcoin Render Network (RNDR) reached its all-time high today, with the RNDR price surging to $10.30 on Binance. The narrative of artificial intelligence coins made a comeback with NVIDIA’s upcoming AI conference and Elon Musk’s lawsuit against Sam Altman.
Indeed, in recent days, there had been indications of potential capital inflows into artificial intelligence coins. The catalyst for this capital was said to be the AI conference taking place between March 17-21.
Render Price Rises Amid AI Coin Narrative
The price of Render Network climbed to $10.30 today. The AI coin saw a significant price increase on Thursday due to rising demand for the altcoin RNDR among market participants.

According to crypto intelligence tracker Santiment’s on-chain data, altcoin RNDR recorded an increase in Active Addresses and the number of whale transactions valued at $100,000 and above. These metrics indicate the level of interest in the asset and demand among investors. According to Santiment’s Realized Profit and Loss metric, Render owners have made a profit of 31.65 million dollars since the beginning of March 2024.

According to Santiment data, the social dominance of altcoin RNDR reached its all-time high as well as a six-month peak. This situation supports the bullish thesis and the possibility of further gains in the token. The cryptocurrency RNDR is trading at $9,739 at the time this article was written. Additionally, the market value of the token has surpassed 3.6 billion dollars today.
Thanks to the power of the artificial intelligence narrative, we see that especially AI-focused coins are gaining strength. Today, alongside the cryptocurrency RNDR, AI coins like FET, AI, and AGIX have shown a 30% increase, reflecting the strength of this narrative.

Unlock the Potential: Raffle Coin (RAFF) Presale Dominance with Polkadot (DOT) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Investors,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 21:02:14.155563,"The bull season always comes with exciting advantages for token holders. With Polkadot (DOT) and Bitcoin (BTC) already far gone in the bull movement, new investors are actively looking for opportunities to join the cryptocurrency space. 
Raffle Coin (RAFF) emerges as a necessary addition to every serious investor’s portfolio. With its array of use cases and interoperability, Raffle Coin (RAFF) is garnering the attention of both new and experienced crypto investors.
Polkadot (DOT) ahead of DOT 2.0
Polkadot (DOT) is one of the better altcoins in the crypto space. The DOT token has done 18.52% in the past 7 days and 50.50% in the past month, making it one of the best investments in the ongoing market rally.
One of the most anticipated developments is Polkadot (DOT) 2.0. This new system is said to represent a next-generation blockchain protocol that addresses scalability, interoperability and security limitations using “parachains”. These Polkadot (DOT) parachains allow different blockchains to connect and communicate with each other, fostering a more interconnected and versatile ecosystem.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Trend That Most Investors Are Missing
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a modest uptick, demonstrating resilience amidst market volatility. With a focus on faster transactions and lower fees, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) aims to enhance usability for everyday transactions. 
Despite challenges, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to position itself as a viable alternative to traditional payment systems. Within the first few days in March, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged from the $310 region to $524. Following the general March 5 dump after Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new ATH, Bitcoin (BTC) was dumped by a lot. At press time, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) trades for $397. 
The BCH token is still 76.54% in the last month, but market analysts know numbers can sometimes be a facade. That’s why more experienced investors are pooling into Raffle Coin (RAFF), a better reliable investment.
The Solution Present Across Portfolios: Raffle Coin (RAFF) 
With an enticing presale price of just $0.016 per token , Raffle Coin (RAFF) stands out as an accessible investment opportunity with significant growth potential. From instant funding options using various cryptocurrencies to a wide array of prizes to choose from, Raffle Coin (RAFF) ensures that users can enjoy the thrill of winning while navigating the platform with the utmost convenience.
One of the most appealing aspects of Raffle Coin (RAFF) is its innovative revenue-sharing model for presale investors. This model guarantees a steady flow of rewards proportionate to token holdings, providing investors with an enticing incentive to participate early. 
Furthermore, the platform’s decentralized governance empowers users to actively contribute to its development and shape its future direction, fostering a sense of community and ownership. 
Compared to other prominent cryptocurrencies like Polkadot (DOT) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Raffle Coin (RAFF) offers a more dynamic and engaging experience for users. With its lower fees, instant withdrawals and immutable blockchain infrastructure, Raffle Coin (RAFF) emerges as a promising contender in the crypto market, poised to unlock the full potential of investors’ portfolios.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hitting $67K Makes Analysts Confident in Their Predictions 
Bitcoin (BTC) has created a buzz recently after hitting $67k. This has helped boost the confidence of analysts who predicted this rise in Bitcoin (BTC) at the start of the year. Now, eyes remain on Bitcoin (BTC) to see how much more it can rise.
Bitcoin (BTC) still battles with Raffle Coin (RAFF) for headlines despite reaching a new all-time high.

Two altcoins leading the charge are The Graph (GRT) and Hedera (HBAR), surging 14% and 11% respectively to trade around $0.35 and $0.13.
The Graph (GRT) Breakout and Bull Run Signals

The cryptocurrency has broken above the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.30, signaling bullish momentum and an uptrend continuation that could lead to a significant price jump towards $0.50. 
This breakout above key Fibonacci levels and the dynamic 50-week EMA hints at a sustained uptrend for GRT in 2024, with the potential to reach $1. Supported by the 50-week EMA, GRT’s bullish reversal gains pace amidst the broader bull market. 



Currently ranked #42 among top coins with a $3 billion market cap, GRT is trading at $0.35 after a recent 16% overnight hike, with a 20% rise in trading volume supporting the bullish trend.

The surge in HBAR’s trading volume accompanies its significant price increase. Notably, HBAR has successfully crossed the psychological $0.10 milestone, indicating a robust uptrend. 
The potential for a golden crossover in HBAR’s weekly chart hints at continued bullish momentum. Additionally, the RSI venturing into overbought territory showcases the strength of the current buying trend for HBAR.
Conclusion
As the crypto market rally rages on, fueled by AI narratives, altcoins like The Graph (GRT) and Hedera (HBAR) are emerging as major beneficiaries. With strong technical indicators and potential for further gains, these projects are capturing investors’ attention and driving the broader market’s momentum. 
While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the current bullish signals suggest that GRT and HBAR may have more room to run in the ongoing crypto market upswing.

SEC Delays Review of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Trading Application,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 21:02:18.284309,"Key Points

The SEC has postponed decision on Nasdaq ISE, LLC’s application to list and trade options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF till April 24.
Decisions on similar applications from Cboe Exchange, Inc. and Miax Pearl LLC have also been delayed to the same date.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deferred its decision on allowing Nasdaq ISE, LLC to list and trade options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The decision, which was initially set to be made earlier, has now been pushed back to April 24.
The SEC stated that it required more time to evaluate the proposed rule change. The commission had previously solicited public comments on the ability of Nasdaq to facilitate options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. This call for comments attracted five responses from individuals, all urging the SEC to approve the options trading.
Other Delays
In addition to the delay on the BlackRock application, decisions on similar applications from Cboe Exchange, Inc. and Miax Pearl LLC have also been postponed. The SEC announced that the deadlines for these decisions have been extended to April 24 as well.
Earlier this year, Cboe submitted a rule filing to the SEC. The exchange stated that its current rules generally allow it to list options on an ETP three days after the ETP shares begin trading on a national securities exchange. However, these rules do not apply to ETPs holding commodities such as Bitcoin.","['SEC', 'PEARL', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9fbedb6d1c9133b5c5910/

Solana Price Forecast: Can SOL Continue To Thrust More Aove $150?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 21:02:19.271290,"
1 The Solana (SOL) crypto is up nearly 9.8% intraday and currently trades at $143.79. 
2 Technical indicators imply a bullish outlook in the short term as the crypto has taken multiple supports from the 20 and 50 EMA.  

The Solana price extended to thrust higher on the second consecutive day and jumped off nearly 10%. The crypto trades near the day’s high and might show more gains by the end of the session.
Moreover, the bulls have regained control after the price broke out of a short term correction phase and surpassed the previous swing high. The 20 and 50-Day EMAs have been acting as dynamic support levels. The SOL crypto took multiple supports from the EMAs and surged higher. 
Recently, Solana witnessed a breakout above the previous swing high of $120 level and has completed the retest. Now, if the price breaks above the weekly high and recent swing of $140 level, it may resume its way towards $150.
On the higher side, $150 level may act as a supply zone and turn out to be a major hurdle for the buyers. If the buyers surpass it, then higher targets of $170 and $180 may be achieved.

The price analysis for the year 2024 is that the SOL token could reach a high of $266, suggesting a potential gain of over 84.4% if the most favorable conditions prevail. Moreover, the less optimistic outlook of the analysts hopes for the crypto to attain $209.

The project focuses on innovations within the VR field, not just with its online platform but also its physical accessories—the Ergonomic Gaming Chair SwiftScape and a VR Ultra headset that boasts high-res visuals and precise motion tracking.

With the booming VR sector anticipated to grow by 104% in the next few years, 5thScape will emerge as a strong contender, giving the 5SCAPE utility token a price boost. 
The rising adoption of the VR sector will undoubtedly push the 5SCAPE token to reach for the moon with the bull run! Furthermore, this unique crypto project will diversify an investor’s crypto portfolio by creating a space for innovation.

Algorand

Algorand prioritizes sustainable blockchain operations by minimizing energy consumption without compromising speed and efficiency. The concerns regarding increased energy consumption harming our planet are hovering over our heads like black clouds. During such times, Algorand’s commitment to a sustainable future is a relief to environmentally conscious investors. 
The native token of Algorand, ALGO, is versatile due to its various uses. In addition to covering transaction fees, it can be used to purchase on-chain items such as NFTs. 

The Graph

Are you struggling to understand blockchain data? The Graph eliminates this complexity with its decentralized indexing and querying protocol. It is a gem of a platform for blockchain and dApps (decentralized applications) developers who want to access the world’s blockchain data and discover thousands of open APIs to use in their projects.
It is truly a one-stop solution for every developer’s needs. As the decentralization of applications and finances in the online world continues to maintain momentum, The Graph platform’s role as a crucial data infrastructure layer becomes even more important, potentially driving a significant bull run for GRT.  

Decentraland 

A metaverse built by the people, for the people—that is Decentraland for you. On this platform, one can interact with new people, make new friends, and attend virtual events, all of which are possible thanks to the platform’s community members. Additionally, the Decentraland platform allows its users to buy and sell wearables, emotes, and attractive (virtual) scenes.
Its virtual events include fashion shows, parties, music festivals, and other entertaining experiences. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? This is all possible with the platform’s MANA utility token. The platform also lets users buy NFTs, which adds more value to this utility token. 
In line with the recent trend of the metaverse, Decentraland is a top platform, making MANA a valuable token for the bull run that this platform and the metaverse concept are heading towards. 

Kusama

The cousin of the Polkadot platform, Kusama unifies several blockchains or “parachains”, making itself a highly secure blockchain platform. Owning and staking KSM makes an investor a key decision-maker on its platform. The more KSM one stakes, the greater your influence on the network they get. Kusama rewards an investor’s participation by minting fresh KSM directly in their wallet, based on the number of coins they stake. This move creates a win-win situation for both the network and the investor.
Why the 5SCAPE Token Should Be in Your Portfolio for the 2024 Crypto Bull Run:
Does 5SCAPE – the utility token of the 5thScape VR platform have the potential to be a game-changing project in the 2024 crypto bull run? We believe so! 
As mentioned earlier, 5thScape is making a futuristic world’s dream a reality. Redefining technological advancements with its VR hub sets a promising narrative for the project’s investors. Since holding 5SCAPE tokens is the only way to access its exclusive VR features, investors should consider grabbing them at their current discounted prices—because its explosive growth is on the cards.
Final Words on Best Crypto For Next Bull Run 
You can capitalize on exponential gains within the crypto sphere by strategically investing in new promising projects like 5thScape before a bull run. The tokens we explored in this article could be tomorrow’s BTC and ETH, with unprecedented growth in the bull run as we move forward. 
Before investing in a new cryptocurrency token, always ensure you have completed thorough research. Take a balanced approach to diversifying your crypto portfolio by investing in traditional coins and altcoins. Investing in the cryptocurrency market is not as mentally taxing as it may seem. Once you understand how to research a crypto project’s platform and mitigate risks and potential losses, this landscape can be a fortune-maker for you.","['MANA', '2024', '2024', 'KSM', 'ALGO']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9fbe5b8024d06250b1836/
Bitcoin Stays Over $67K as Stocks Rise: An Anticipation of Fed Capitol Hill’s Statements,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 21:02:21.369136,"Key Points

Bitcoin remains over $67,000, rising alongside Wall Street ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony.
Anticipation of Fed rate cuts and cooling inflation data are key influences on the market.

Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market capitalization, is maintaining its position above $67,000. This comes as Wall Street experiences gains in midday trading, all in anticipation of the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s concluding remarks on U.S. monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee.
At 11:30 a.m. ET, Bitcoin was valued at $67,199, marking an increase of about 1% in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, U.S. indices have been on the rise. Major equities have recovered from losses earlier in the week, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq Composite all seeing gains.
Market Influences
One of the factors supporting risk assets is the affirmation by Fed officials, including Jerome Powell, that the Fed is still on track to cut rates this year. This has led to a slight decrease in the U.S. dollar’s value. Even gold has reached all-time highs. Powell had previously informed the U.S House Financial Services Committee that he anticipates interest rate cuts later this year, though he did not specify when.
Rate Cuts and Inflation
There is growing anticipation of Fed rate cuts. Powell’s testimony on Capitol Hill about interest-rate policy is eagerly awaited. According to analysts, a rate cut move by the U.S. central bank largely depends on the cooling of inflation data over the next few months. The consensus is that the Fed just needs a few more months of similar inflation data as previous months to start cutting rates this year.
Currently, there is a 97% chance that the Fed funds rate will remain at its current target range of 5.25%–5.50% this month. However, interest rate traders’ forecasts for the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicate a 56.9% probability of a rate cut in that month.
Meanwhile, the GM 30 Index, which represents a selection of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, has increased by 2.85% to 147.78 in the past 24 hours.","['RSV', 'CHAIR', 'BTC', 'CPTL', 'RSRV']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9fbecb8024d06250b183a/
Smog Price Prediction: SMOG Explodes 477% In A Month As Solana Competitors BONK And WIF Languish And This New AI Meme Coin Soars Towards $4 ...,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 21:02:22.464278,"
The Smog price has skyrocketed more than 477% in the last month to trade at $0.281 as of 8:05 a.m. EST as investors scoop up as much of the Solana meme coin as possible.
Meanwhile, other Solana meme coins such as Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) saw their prices fall in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows that BONK registered a 12% 24-hour loss, while WIF saw its price drop more than 9% over the past day.
The Smog Price Attempts To Break Resistance



4-hour chart for SMOG/USDT (Source: TradingView)
The Smog price is attempting to overcome the resistance level at $0.2862. Should the crypto close a 4-hour candle above this threshold in the next 24 hours, then it may have the foundation needed to keep rising in the short term.
However, a rejection from the $0.2862 may expose the crypto to the risk of correcting down to the immediate support level at $0.2134 in the following 48 hours. Continued sell pressure at this point could then drag the Smog price all the way down to $0.1597 in the short term.
Technical Indicators Suggest The Smog Price May Keep Climbing
Technical indicators on SMOG’s 4-hour chart suggest any potential correction in the meme coin’s price may be a liquidity building move before another leg up. Both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are flagging bullish on the 4-hour chart, suggesting the crypto’s price may continue to rise in the coming days.
The MACD line is breaking away above the MACD Signal line. Traders generally see this as a sign that a crypto is in a bullish trend. The increasing gap between the two lines may signal that SMOG’s bullish trend is growing stronger as well.
In addition to this, the RSI indicator shows that the Smog price has a lot of bullish strength, as the RSI is above 50. Although the current reading of 77 may suggest the crypto is overbought, potentially leading to a correction, it is not unusual for a crypto to remain overbought for extended periods of time when it is pumping.
While the Smog price looks set to keep rising in the short term, investors are scrambling to buy into Scotty the AI, as its presale races towards $4 million.
A Meme Coin Taking Cyber Criminals Head On
Scotty the AI is an AI-powered meme coin that aims to protect investors in the expanding digital asset realm. With its sophisticated AI models, it is able to analyze countless lines of code to identify any potential security threats or software bugs that may lead to a loss of funds for unsuspecting investors.





The crypto community already has two cutting edge AI tools at its disposal within the Scotty the AI ecosystem. First is the project’s flagship offering, an AI-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) called Scotty Swap.
 What sets this platform apart from others is its ability to inspect the underlying code of transactions that it facilitates. Should it discover anything suspicious in the smart contracts’s code, or any other element of the swap transaction, it will send a notification to the user before executing the swap.
The second product on offer through the AI meme coin’s ecosystem is an innovative AI-powered chatbot by the name of Scotty Chat. This neat chatbot is able to act as a guide to the Web3 space, and answer any related questions users may have.
Investors Prepare For Potential 100X Returns
Investors are buying into Scotty the AI at a rapid pace, as shown by a presale that is fast-approaching the $4 million milestone. The altcoin’s clever positioning in both the vibrant meme coin sector and the booming AI crypto space may be one of the main factors that has investors excited. 
There is also a lucrative staking program that offers up to 57% in annual rewards for presale investors.

🚨 ScottyTheAi # 1 memecoin of 2024

All investors will need to do to gain access to these rewards is buy Scotty the AI’s native token, SCOTTY, through the project’s official website. 
The token is currently selling for $0.00805 and can be bought using MATIC, BNB, ETH, USDT or bank card. However, purchases made using BNB and MATIC will not be eligible for the project’s staking rewards. Investors will want to hurry though, as SCOTTY’s price is set to increase in subsequent presale rounds.
SCOTTY can be purchased here.

Best Bitcoin Mining Crypto Project to Invest in 2024 – Cilinix Crypto Presale Update,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 21:02:23.932707,"
Cilinix Crypto offers video updates about this stake-to-mine crypto, which he claims is the best Bitcoin mining crypto project of 2024.
Bitcoin’s climb above $65,000 has analysts discussing whether it could hit $70,000 in March, while excitement grows for the upcoming IEO of Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).
Bitcoin Minetrix is a crypto project that aims to make Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone through a unique feature called stake-to-mine. With this, you don’t need costly Bitcoin mining hardware or the electricity to run it anymore.





Bitcoin Minetrix ICO approaches $12 million
Bitcoin has surged past $65,000, marking a significant milestone since December 2021, sparking optimism among many about the future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Crypto enthusiasts attribute this new high to institutional adoption and the upcoming halving, fueling excitement in the community.
Amid the buzz surrounding Bitcoin’s breakthrough, attention has turned to a new crypto project: Bitcoin Minetrix. The platform, offering tokenized cloud mining, is on the verge of raising nearly $12 million in its presale initial coin offering (ICO).
Bitcoin Minetrix isn’t just relying on hype and community growth; it’s also introducing a Stake-to-Mine approach that could revolutionize cloud mining. The aim is to provide everyday crypto enthusiasts with a straightforward way to earn Bitcoin through cloud mining, eliminating risks associated with third-party providers.
By staking $BTCMTX tokens, holders can earn a substantial Annual Percentage Yield (APY), currently offering up to 58% annually. The current token price is $0.0139, set to increase in less than 4 days when the next stage begins.
Participating in the Bitcoin Minetrix presale is straightforward, with various payment options available, including Ethereum, USDT, credit cards, BNB, and MATIC. For a comprehensive guide on purchasing $BTCMTX, please refer to our provided guide here.
Why Bitcoin Minetrix might be your ideal cloud mining solution?
Cloud mining has been around for a while, emerging as traditional mining became dominated by large companies. It involves users renting or purchasing shared computing power and covering the significant energy costs.
While many investors have found success with cloud mining, the space is increasingly attracting scammers. They often require hefty upfront payments and offer complex contracts, making it challenging to determine potential BTC earnings.

Additionally, there are often added fees at the end of contracts, such as for energy consumption and hardware maintenance, which can eat into profits. Bitcoin Minetrix is enhancing security and transparency in cloud mining by allowing users to stake tokens without additional cash payments.
Tokens can be unstaked and sold on an exchange at any time. The lock-in period is chosen by the investor, unlike fixed terms in other cloud mining projects. Coinsult has conducted a comprehensive audit of the smart contract to provide investors with peace of mind.
To delve deeper into the potential value of this project, explore our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction.
Bitcoin Minetrix tokenomics, roadmap and airdrop
In terms of tokenomics, 42.5% of the BTCMTX token will support Bitcoin Minetrix operations, with 35% designated for marketing, 12.5% for staking, and 10% devoted to the community.
Bitcoin Minetrix has received recognition from major news outlets, such as Cointelegraph, Business Insider, CryptoPotato, and others. The project’s roadmap illustrates key stages, showcasing the team’s commitment to Bitcoin Minetrix’s enduring prosperity.
These stages encompass platform development, facility setup, app and desktop software development, team expansion, negotiations with cloud mining conglomerates, and listings on centralized exchanges. The community’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin Minetrix is evident through various campaigns and airdrops they organize.
To further boost excitement surrounding its progress, the project has introduced a significant airdrop, offering a generous prize pool of $30,000 distributed among ten lucky winners, with each potentially receiving a reward of $3,000.
Participating in the airdrop is straightforward—visit their website, follow their social media accounts, and complete additional tasks to enter the gleam competition. With more than 51,201 entries and 116 days left, this airdrop offers an enticing chance for participants to potentially win significant cash prizes.
Conclusion
Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) presents an innovative crypto presale project, marking a significant advancement with its stake-to-mine utility, a world-first offering in the crypto space.
This feature allows any investor to initiate Bitcoin mining securely and affordably, starting from as low as $10, while also receiving substantial staking rewards from the staking pool.
Furthermore, tokens are available at a discounted price during the initial stages of the presale, providing early participants with the chance to acquire additional tokens at a reduced cost. To take part in the $BTCMTX presale, visit bitcoinminetrix.com.

SEC Postpones Verdict on Cboe’s Bitcoin ETF Options Proposal,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 21:02:27.166859,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: SEC Postpones Verdict on Cboe’s Bitcoin ETF Options Proposal
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deferred the review of Cboe’s proposition to offer options trading for Bitcoin ETFs, a move with substantial implications for the fusion of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial sector. The SEC’s delay until late April injects a dose of uncertainty into the market, signaling careful scrutiny in the adoption of cryptocurrency-based financial products.
Implications for Market Strategies
Options play a crucial role in risk management by ensuring the ability to buy or sell assets at a predetermined price. Linking such derivatives to Bitcoin ETFs could empower investors to craft sophisticated hedging tactics. The SEC’s hesitation, therefore, has repercussions that span both the digital currency domain and the broader financial ecosystem.
The ripple effect of the SEC’s decision extends to other exchanges, which are also pursuing similar listings. This includes NYSE’s applications for commodity-based shares and Nasdaq’s plans to introduce options for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, illustrating a growing interest in such financial instruments.
Looking Towards a Thorough Evaluation
While Bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock’s IBIT foster institutional engagement in cryptocurrencies, and enhance product variety and market liquidity, the SEC’s pending comprehensive evaluation, especially concerning Grayscale’s GBTC options, points to a cautious regulatory approach.
Grayscale’s plea for the SEC to normalize and approve options across the board, whether assets include Bitcoin holdings or not, underscores the push for broader acceptance and integration of digital assets in financial offerings. The SEC’s upcoming rulings will be pivotal in harmonizing the cryptocurrency industry with traditional financial entities, but the path forward remains replete with unknowns, poised for further debate and unfolding events.

NEAR Coin’s Unexpected Surge Shakes the Crypto Market,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 21:02:28.802342,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: NEAR Coin’s Unexpected Surge Shakes the Crypto Market
Cryptocurrency markets have recently been marked by significant rallies, with several altcoins doubling or tripling in value. However, these trends are not indefinite, and even in strong market phases, substantial drops in value can occur. Altcoins, in particular, can see reductions in value by half or more, as history has shown in previous market cycles.
NEAR’s Struggle and Recovery
NEAR Coin, notably impacted by the FTX collapse, saw a quick offloading by investors, resulting in a stark decrease in value. Unlike SOL Coin, NEAR did not manage a substantial recovery, partly due to the potential emergence of various competitors. Nonetheless, after a prolonged period of decline, NEAR Coin recently achieved a notable 38% increase within the span of 24 hours, catching investors and bears by surprise.
The unexpected rise followed three consecutive days of declines, which had suggested a steady downtrend. The rebound was reinforced by a liquidation of short positions totaling $2.23 million, which prompted a shift to a positive funding rate in futures markets, averaging 0.0670%. Concurrently, the network’s total value locked (TVL) saw a 22.5% increase, signaling growing confidence in the asset.
Future Price Movements for NEAR Coin
While NEAR’s price has increased, it is yet to establish strong support above a critical resistance level. Currently, bulls face a barrier at $5.6, but if overcome, the price may ascend to $6.5. The futures market indicates that bears might approach with caution, which could inadvertently fortify the ongoing uptrend.
Investors should, however, proceed with caution due to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating an oversold condition. External factors like upcoming US data or sudden profit-taking in the BTC market could aid bears in pushing NEAR’s price down. If the RSI remains high and the price stays above $5.6, the outlook is positive, but a fall below this threshold could see prices retract to $4.85 or lower.

Cryptocurrencies have been experiencing impressive rallies for a while, with many altcoins gaining 2 to 3 times their value. However, this will not continue indefinitely. Even in bull markets, we can see a general market value drop of 30% and altcoin drops of 50% or more. This is a situation we have encountered in previous cycles.
NEAR Coin
One of the altcoins that suffered the most from the FTX collapse was NEAR Coin. Its biggest supporter, a bankrupt crypto initiative, faced rapid sales by investors who lost their long-term optimism, causing significant damage. Moreover, it did not experience a major comeback like SOL Coin. The reason is the potential for many alternatives to take its place.
After two and a half years of struggle, NEAR Coin has seen a 38% increase in the last 24 hours. This comeback, following three days of selling candles, caught many by surprise. Bears, having confirmed a persistent decline with the third candle, were caught off guard by the subsequent rise.

Following the liquidation of $2.23 million in short positions, the funding rate in futures markets became significantly positive, averaging 0.0670%. On the other hand, the total value locked (TVL) on the network also increased by 22.5% within 24 hours, rising from $155 million to $189 million.

NEAR Coin Price Prediction
The NEAR price has risen, but we have yet to see strong closures above the key selling wall. For now, bulls are blocked at $5.6, making it easier for bears as time passes. In an optimistic scenario, if resistance is permanently overcome, the price could climb to the next hurdle at $6.5. The outlook in futures markets suggests that bears may continue to be cautious during this rise, which could potentially accelerate the uptrend.

However, since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the oversold region, investors waiting to take profits should be much more cautious. Upcoming US data or possible rapid profit-taking in the BTC channel will be highly supportive for NEAR bears.
If the RSI remains in the overbought region and NEAR Coin closes above $5.6, there is no problem. However, if the RSI declines while the price closes below $5.6, it could lead to a drop to $4.85 or lower.

Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 20:02:32.854922,"A team of researchers from the United Arab Emirates recently conducted a study to discover what people thought about the metaverse on social media.
The team curated a data set of 86,565 posts on the X social media platform and used machine learning to divide them into three categories representing sentiment: positive, neutral and negative.
According to the researchers, the distribution showed that posts expressing positive sentiments about the metaverse took up the lion’s share of the data with 45,506 (53% of the total). The researchers identified 28,663 posts displaying neutral sentiment, making up 33% of the total, and the final 14% (12,396 posts) showed negative sentiment. 
An example of a positive post (called “tweets” in the paper) given in the paper was “good morning everyonenlet (sic) keep building the metaverse.” At the other end of the spectrum, an example given of a post labeled as negative was “correct me if im wrong but isnt the metaverse just going to be like an mmorpg where you have to do your job surrounded by irritating npcs if so ill stick with irl interactions please.”
The team states, in their paper, that positive and negative sentiments followed patterns, but neutral sentiment didn’t:

 “The positive tweets contain a lot of words supporting metaverse adoption including ‘need’, ‘love’, ‘right, ‘future’, and ‘new’. In contrast, the negative tweets besides containing words such as ‘bad’, ‘crazy’, and ‘don’t’, also contained many offensive words. No distinct pattern of words is evident in neutral sentiment tweets.”

They also write that this “offers early promising signs for the adoption of metaverse technology.”



Image source: Hayawi, et. al., 2024.


Previous studies using machine learning to deduce metaverse sentiment from social media posts have reached around 88% accuracy in benchmarks — meaning more than 1 in 10 posts are mislabeled or misinterpreted by the models. 
The U.A.E. team’s models reached as high as 92.6% accuracy across a data set containing more than 85,000 posts, making this study one of the most detailed analyses of public sentiment for metaverse to date. It bears mention, however, that this is preprint research and, as such, may not have been through the peer review process.

Future research will focus on other social media platforms, including Meta and Reddit, as well as integrating offline and traditional sentiment analysis such as scientific surveys, to create a more comprehensive picture. 
The researchers also admit the current research is limited by the terminology used to conduct the study, namely that the scope of their work was limited only to posts containing the word “metaverse” and, as such, social media discussions about the topic but not containing the keyword were omitted from consideration.","['FTR', 'UTED', 'X', 'X', 'META']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9f85435539f471eb40903/
The ether is breaking records: Ethereum’s crypto soaring to historic highs!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 20:02:36.833749,"Ether (ETH), the second most popular cryptocurrency in the market, is drawing investors’ attention due to its exceptional performance. Like bitcoin (BTC), which it follows, it has reached an all-time high price of $3,800. Here’s how analysts explain this surge in power.
The reasons behind the surge of Ethereum’s native crypto
Like the price of bitcoin, ether has shown a remarkable surge in power. A dynamic that has recently taken the crypto to a valuation of $3,800. An absolutely historic record.




While the question arises as to how the asset managed such a performance, Michael Van Pope, a well-known analyst in the crypto industry, gave his opinion on the matter. According to his view, ether’s breakthrough is due to two factors.
The first is linked to expectations around Dencun. This is an upgrade that Ethereum is expected to undergo soon. An update that should address many of the platform’s challenges in terms of transaction fees, scalability, and attractiveness.
The second factor behind the rise of ether comes from speculation about the potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF. An option that should improve the accessibility of institutional investors to this crypto, similar to what is observed with Bitcoin ETFs.

Factors behind the rise of ether according to Michael Van Pope


A surge that’s just beginning?
Analyzing the dynamics of ether, Michael Van Pope highlights Ethereum’s certain robustness relative to resistance levels. Moreover, the crypto seems to show a relatively stable behavior compared to bitcoin.
Thus, according to the analyst, ether is demonstrating remarkable resilience. It manages to progress in a more consistent manner. This suggests that it is in a solid position compared to bitcoin and the challenges of the crypto market in general.
Based on this observation, he believes Ethereum is ready to achieve significant new gains in the coming weeks and months. These would also be driven by the Dencun upgrade and the possible approval of an Ethereum spot ETF.
In essence, Michael Van Pope’s projection is not new. In early February, he had notably anticipated a market explosion around Ethereum, driven not only by the two arguments previously mentioned but also by a reallocation of profits from BTC to ETH.","['ETH', 'BASED', '2024', 'PEL', 'ETF']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9f85728248d6e30663b11/
"Core Scientific Inks $100M Collaboration with CoreWeave, Expanding Mining Revenue Streams",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 20:02:39.943677,"Key Points

Bitcoin mining firm Core Scientific is diversifying its revenue streams by partnering with AI startup CoreWeave.
The partnership could generate over $100 million in revenue as Core Scientific expands into high-performance computing.

Bitcoin mining company, Core Scientific, is taking strides to diversify its revenue streams ahead of the upcoming halving event.
In a significant move, the firm has partnered with artificial intelligence startup, CoreWeave, to provide data center services. This collaboration has the potential to generate revenue exceeding $100 million.
Expanding Business Horizons
Core Scientific has taken on the lease of a tier 3 data center in Austin, Texas, previously occupied by Hewlett Packard, to host CoreWeave’s infrastructure.
As per the agreement, Core Scientific will supply up to 16 MW of capacity at its new Austin data center, thereby broadening its business scope to include high-performance computing (HPC).
Backed by major Wall Street financial firms, including Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Fidelity, CoreWeave is an AI cloud computing company.
It provides infrastructure for compute-intensive applications, such as machine learning, and was valued at $7 billion as of December 2023.
Impact of the Bitcoin Halving
Core Scientific’s expansion into new service areas comes just weeks before the Bitcoin halving event, which will cut BTC’s block reward revenue by half.
The 2024 halving for Bitcoin, succeeding the previous ones in 2020, 2016, and 2012, will reduce the block reward for miners from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.
This halving aims to control Bitcoin’s inflation by gradually decreasing the supply of new coins.
While this will significantly reduce miners’ revenue, the costs associated with mining are expected to rise.
According to a CoinShares analysis, electricity costs per Bitcoin before and after the halving constitute about 68% and 71% of miners’ total cost structure, respectively.
Post-halving, the average production cost for crypto miners is estimated to be $37,856.
In 2023, Core Scientific became North America’s largest publicly listed crypto mining company after mining 19,274 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $812 million.
The company recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States after a 13-month restructuring process to address $400 million in debt caused by falling BTC prices, rising energy costs, and debt linked to the bankrupt Celsius Network.","['AI', 'CORE', 'CEL', 'BTC', 'IMX']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9f859b8024d06250b1830/

This proposal aims to enhance chain security and decentralization by increasing the number of validators, thereby improving network security.Terra Luna Classic: Proposal for 5% Validator CommissionThe Terra Luna Classic community is currently voting on Proposal 12089, which seeks to reintroduce a 5% commission for validators. This commission had been restricted following the introduction of the dynamic commission (DynComm) last year. Importantly, this proposed parameter change does not impact the DynComm Module.The rationale behind the proposal is to address the need for reimplementation of a minimum fee to support the active set of validators and facilitate ongoing development efforts. The proposal highlights the loss of several validators over the past five months, with some struggling to cover the costs of running their nodes. This situation is anticipated to worsen as delegators withdraw their stake during bullish market phases to capitalize on profits.Furthermore, the proposal cites examples of validators such as PFC, TMOM, and Lux Blockchain that have ceased operations, along with others nearing closure due to financial challenges. Additionally, it notes instances where validators have shut down without notifying their delegators or failing to upgrade to maintain their position in the active set, resulting in a substantial amount of staked LUNC being jailed.Also Read:   SEC Commissioners Challenge ""Come Register"" Plea for CryptoIf passed, the proposal is expected to offer benefits to delegates and mitigate the risk of Sybil Attacks.

Excitement Peaks as Raffle Coin (RAFF) Surges with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) & Cardano (ADA) Bulls Predicting 100X Gains In Early March,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 20:02:49.518011,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a recent rally, indicating bullish action on the token. A weekly analysis of the token indicates a 30.26% increase and a 75.31% surge in the last 30 days. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) started as a hard fork of the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem as developers expressed displeasure on Bitcoin’s scalability.
Since their split, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have forged different paths in the crypto space, even while satisfying similar use cases like seamless transactions, decentralization and profitability.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may have seen a surge as a result of the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may see another massive pump that will push the project towards its former ATH.
Cardano (ADA) Picks Up Momentum as $1 Valuation Comes Into View
Few projects have faced the challenges experienced by Cardano (ADA) in the crypto industry. Cardano (ADA) has been involved with a long drawn-out battle with regulatory bodies and the SEC, which shows the project’s commitment to decentralization.
An upward trend has been observed in Cardano (ADA) this past week as the project raked in 15.2% in price appreciation. Experts are confident that Cardano (ADA) may experience a massive pump that could send the project to $10 by year’s end. This would go a long way to drive adoption towards Cardano (ADA) as the current social dominance for the project is low. Smart investors are buying to position for massive gains as they also consider Raffle Coin (RAFF) in its presale.
Raffle Coin (RAFF) Offers Unique Presale as Investors Predict Huge Pump
Many crypto projects blow up in their earlier phases, benefiting early investors. A presale phase is a unique opportunity to get in early on a profitable project like Raffle Coin (RAFF). The blockchain-powered project provides a decentralized means of conducting raffles and lotteries with diverse games and mouth-watering prizes.
Raffle Coin (RAFF) prioritizes community growth as is seen through its decentralized governance model, enabling stakers to earn VIP rewards on the staked assets. A loyalty bonus is also available for recurrent users in the Raffle Coin (RAFF) platform. Raffle Coin (RAFF) is running 6 stages of its presale phase and with the first one ongoing, tokens are rapidly selling out at $0.016, underscoring the importance of getting in early.
Raffle Coin (RAFF) has a unique use case and potential for profitability, hence the interest shown by Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA) investors. The project is poised to pull off a 100x pump and presale holders are geared for massive profits as the project’s roadmap rolls out.

SEC Delays Important Decision on Bitcoin Spot ETFs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-07 20:02:51.998028,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on proposals to allow Cboe Global Markets to list and trade options on Bitcoin ETFs.
Cboe Global Markets, a leading exchange firm, first applied to list and trade options on the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs in January. The SEC announced Wednesday that it will delay its decision on the proposed rule change until the end of April.
Options are financial instruments that can be used to hedge risk and allow an investor to enter into a contract in which he can buy or sell a financial product at a certain price within a certain time period.
Under normal circumstances, Cboe may offer options three days after an ETP begins trading on a national securities exchange, such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. However, these rules do not apply to ETPs with commodities such as Bitcoin.
In addition to the SEC approving Cboe's rule application, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) may need certain approvals from its regulators, including the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to issue and clear these options.
Related News: JUST IN: Elon Musk commented on the photo with PEPE in it
Cboe isn't the only exchange looking to offer options. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has also filed to list “commodity-backed trust shares.” Nasdaq, meanwhile, is looking to list and trade options specifically on BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
In its application in January, Nasdaq stated that options would offer investors a “lower cost investment tool” while also offering a hedging tool. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has amassed $10 billion in assets under management in its first few months, while Grayscale's BTC ETF, converted from a Bitcoin trust, has $26 billion in assets under management.
The SEC also announced Wednesday that it was delaying a decision on proposed rule changes, and all three rule change proposals now have the same late-April decision date.

Pantera Capital is a leading asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrencies, with assets totaling $5.2 billion. The firm wants to acquire up to $250 million in SOL tokens from FTX’s assets. This information comes from promotional documents distributed in February to potential backers, as reported by Bloomberg Intelligence. 
Investors participating can purchase SOL at a 39% reduction from its 30-day average cost, specifically at $59.95, provided compliance with a vesting term of up to four years. Solana is currently trading at over $145.

The latest bull run saw Solana rally over 600% in a year. The surge offers a prime opportunity for the bankrupt exchange to mobilize funds to settle its creditor obligations. Notably, the coin’s market price has quadrupled since FTX’s collapse in November 2022. FTX’s co-founder and ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who currently awaits sentencing, had significantly supported the Solana ecosystem.
However, Pantera Capital is not alone in recognizing this investment potential. Phoenix Digital LLC, a New York-based investment fund, is also pursuing a deal to acquire SOL from the FTX estate. The firm offers $64 per token, representing a 51% markdown from its recent market value.

The program underscores Travala.com’s recognition of Bitcoin as a leading cryptocurrency and its limited supply as a digital asset.
Juan Otero, Travala.com CEO, emphasized Bitcoin’s enduring appeal, particularly in light of the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF):

“Bitcoin is here to stay, and it’s now becoming more appealing to mainstream audiences, thanks to the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.” — Juan Otero, Travala.com CEO

What can Travala.com users look forward to?
The program offers members flexibility in utilizing their Bitcoin rewards, be it for future travel bookings or withdrawals to external wallets, exchanges, or platforms. 
However, access to the BTC cashback program requires ownership of a Travel Tiger NFT and staking 2,500 AVA tokens to activate Smart Diamond membership. 
With only 1,000 of them in circulation, Travel Tiger NFTs come with a floor price of 2.6 Ethereum (ETH), valued at around $9,800 at current market rates.
Travala.com envisions cryptocurrency-based cashback programs as potential disruptors of conventional Web2-based schemes, citing potential fee cuts and lower fraud risks associated with traditional payment channels.Otero is optimistic that Bitcoin rewards could serve as a gateway for new users into the Web3 ecosystem, leveraging Travala.com’s AVA Foundation blockchain platform and native AVA tokens for disbursing cashback and loyalty rewards, payment discounts, and exclusive access benefits.

Bitcoin call options clustering at $70k show bullish skew,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 20:03:01.143113,"Analysts highlight the significant concentration of call options for Bitcoin, set to expire at the end of March, with a strike price of $70,000.
This information, provided by Bitfinex‘s Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner, suggests a growing optimism regarding Bitcoin’s (BTC) value.

Kooner notes that the put-call ratio, a key indicator of market sentiment, has consistently remained below 0.6 for the first time in six months, indicating a bullish outlook among traders.
The global put-call ratio for Bitcoin options now stands at 0.6, according to The Block’s Data Dashboard. A ratio below 1 signals bullish sentiment, as it shows a preference for calls, which are bets on the asset’s price increase.
Conversely, a ratio above 1 would indicate bearish sentiment, highlighting a greater interest in puts, which are protective measures against a price decline.

Kooner pointed out that implied volatility in the options market has decreased noticeably. The decrease has reduced option premiums, making it more cost-effective for traders to enter positions.
Specifically, Deribit’s implied volatility index for Bitcoin fell from 77% to 72% over the past 24 hours. Lower volatility expectations suggest traders anticipate less price fluctuation shortly, affecting the pricing of options contracts.
Options are financial derivatives that allow traders the choice, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified date.
Call options grant the right to buy, whereas put options offer the right to sell. Purchasing put options generally reflects a bearish market view, while purchasing call options indicates a bullish stance.

SEC Delays Decision on Bitcoin ETF Options Listing by Cboe,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 20:03:05.652498,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: SEC Delays Decision on Bitcoin ETF Options Listing by Cboe
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has postponed the application by Cboe to list and trade options for Bitcoin ETFs. This development is emerging as a significant event in the cryptocurrency and financial markets. This decision provides important clues regarding the integration and acceptance of the cryptocurrency world into the traditional financial system.
Cboe Had Applied in January
Cboe‘s application in January was seen as a step towards diversifying financial products based on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and increasing their trading volume. However, the SEC’s postponement of this application until the end of April has created uncertainty in the market.
Options are significant instruments that provide risk management by guaranteeing the purchase or sale of financial products at a certain price. Therefore, associating these options with Bitcoin ETFs could allow investors to develop their hedging strategies.

However, the postponement of Cboe’s application affects not only the cryptocurrency world but also traditional financial institutions. In particular, similar applications by other exchanges and the SEC’s decisions on this matter could be decisive for the future of the market.
The applications by NYSE for commodity-based trust shares and Nasdaq’s intention to list options for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF are also noteworthy in this context.
A More Comprehensive Review is Underway
Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT, while increasing the interest of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency market, are important for diversifying these types of products and providing liquidity. However, the SEC is expected to consider concerns related to options in Grayscale’s GBTC and to follow a more comprehensive review process.
Grayscale’s call to the SEC is also striking. The company is demanding the standardization and approval of option products regardless of whether the assets hold Bitcoin or not. This development is an important step in terms of accepting cryptocurrency assets and encouraging greater integration among financial products.
The SEC’s decisions will continue to be decisive in the process of bringing together the cryptocurrency market and traditional financial institutions and achieving harmony. However, it is important to remember that this process is fraught with uncertainties and that more discussions and developments may occur in the coming days.

This significant growth suggests a phase of accumulation among investors or a pattern of consistent holding. Such behavior indicates a collective anticipation of future price increases or a belief in the long-term value of LINK.

Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Plummets 14% As Experts Say This New Green ICO Might Be The Best Crypto To Buy Now,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 20:03:10.406566,"The Shiba Inu price has plunged 14% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.00003198 as of 7 a.m. EST on a 60% drop in trading volume to $4.7 billion.
SHIB’s fall comes amid a broad selloff in the meme coin sector after a surging rally fired by Bitcoin’s pump to a new all-time high.
The Shiba Inu Price: Buyers Gearing Up For Another Bull Rally?
SHIBUSDT Analysis By Tradingview
The Shiba Inu price indicates a gradual uptrend after experiencing an extended period of consolidation. During this time, a support zone was formed at $0.00001030, which aided the bulls in driving the price upwards.
Yet, the bulls encountered resistance when the price reached the $0.00004512 level, resulting in pressure from the bears, pushing the price down to $0.00002853. This formation has created a bullish pennant, indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.
The bulls have shown resilience, rebounding twice as they gather forces on the $0.00002853 support level to initiate a bull rally above the bullish pennant.
The price trades above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which currently support the price. The moving average cross at $0.00001040 affirms the generally bullish outlook for Shiba Inu price.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates a downtrend as it consolidates on the 50 midline level. A rebound from this level could see the RSI surge back to the overbought region, indicating intense buying pressure for the Shiba Inu price.
The Shiba Inu Price Bulls Target $0.00006288 Mark Above The Pennant
Shiba Inu price is a bullish bias as the bulls aim to push the price to the $0.00006288 mark. The support zone at $0.00002863 and the golden cross at $0.00001040 support further upside potential. If the momentum sustains strongly, a breach above this level could see SHIB reach a new all-time high in the upcoming weeks.
Conversely, the RSI  being in the overbought region could trigger a potential price correction. This might encourage the bears to take control and drive the price down, forcing the bulls to retreat to the $0.00001216 support zone.
As Shiba Inu traders await favourable new entry positions, some investors are being drawn to the new eTukTuk token, which is opening doors to a greener future in transportation with its $TUK token presale.

Travala Introduces Cashback Rewards in Bitcoin for Luxury Travels,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 20:03:14.767588,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Travala Introduces Cashback Rewards in Bitcoin for Luxury Travels
The cryptocurrency-friendly travel agency Travala has unveiled an innovative Bitcoin cashback incentive for its most dedicated customers. The company announced that travelers who achieve the highest tier in their loyalty program will receive Bitcoin as part of their rewards. This offering aligns with Travala’s commitment to integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream travel experiences.
CEO Highlights Bitcoin’s Growing Popularity in Travel
Juan Otero, the CEO of Travala, points out that Bitcoin’s widespread recognition and finite nature make it an attractive reward for travelers. He mentioned the rising interest in Bitcoin following the recent launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, indicating the cryptocurrency’s solidification in the public’s investment portfolio. Otero believes that integrating Bitcoin rewards with travel expenses will encourage more travelers to adopt cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions.
The company has confirmed that travel rewards will be transferred into customers’ accounts swiftly after completing their journey, offering flexibility in how they utilize their Bitcoin, from new travel bookings to external transfers. Travala has seen a significant portion of its bookings paid with Bitcoin, demonstrating the platform’s success in merging travel services with digital currency payments.
Exclusive Access Through NFT Ownership
Travala’s cashback program requires ownership of a Travel Tiger NFT and a deposit of AVA tokens, adding a layer of exclusivity and integrating non-fungible tokens into the rewards scheme. These NFTs are part of a limited collection on the Ethereum blockchain, with a market value reflecting their scarcity and desirability among travelers.
In addition to promoting its Bitcoin cashback offering, Travala is also advocating for the broader adoption of crypto-based rewards over traditional loyalty programs. The company suggests that Bitcoin can help lower transaction fees and reduce the risk of fraud. By offering Bitcoin and AVA token rewards, Travala’s CEO aims to draw new users into the Web3 ecosystem, enhancing the travel experience with the benefits of the blockchain technology.

Fed Chair Powell Speaks on Monetary Policy and CBDC Stance,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 20:03:20.067797,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Fed Chair Powell Speaks on Monetary Policy and CBDC Stance
The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently addressed key issues related to the U.S. economy, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and banking sector stability. Contrary to expectations, Powell’s speech largely echoed previous statements, with new cautions on the potential for small bank failures.
Central Bank Digital Currency Update
In his address, Powell explicitly stated that the Federal Reserve is not close to endorsing or implementing a CBDC. He suggested that the idea is still premature, signaling a cautious approach to digital fiat currency from the central bank. Additionally, Powell offered insights into the current status of the U.S. economy, describing it as robust and on a sustainable growth track.
Economic Outlook and Policy Adjustments
Powell remarked on the housing market difficulties and the possibility of a recovery influenced by decreasing interest rates and inflation. However, he was clear about the ongoing housing shortage that will likely keep prices high. Moreover, Powell indicated that should the economy proceed as anticipated, the Fed might start easing its restrictive monetary policy stance within the year.
The Fed chair also mentioned the labor market cooling down and the stabilization of food inflation. He highlighted that various insurance types have been a major inflation driver recently. Regarding the banking sector, Powell forecasted failures within the realm of smaller and medium-sized banks, specifically due to commercial real estate exposures, noting that larger banks are at less risk.
Complementing Powell’s perspective, Fed member Mester expressed concerns over persistent inflation this year while acknowledging the possibility of policy adjustments if economic forecasts are met. This tandem of views paints a picture of cautious optimism and vigilance from the Federal Reserve’s leadership.

Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) Proudly Announces Mining Decentralization with Bitcoin (BTC) Merge Mining Opportunity,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Crypto Adventure,2024-03-07 20:03:22.493212,"Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) has recently completed a successful fork and can now be merge mined alongside Bitcoin (BTC) in a decentralized manner.Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) was launched in 2019 as an alpha chain. It was development heavily between December 2019 and November 2020, which saw the release of the key feature enabling reversible transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin Vault is the world’s first cryptocurrency that allows users to cancel transactions after they are posted to the blockchain. This revolutionary approach is possible with a customized blockchain protocol which confirms payments within 144 blocks (or around 24 hours). This feature protects users from losing their funds in case of common key thefts, user mistakes or errors and bugs.When Bitcoin Vault was first launched, it was quickly centralized in order to secure its blockchain against a 51% attack, and to prevent any such attacks in its future. However, the cryptocurrency landscape has changed significantly since then, and new challenges have emerged. One of the most important challenges facing Bitcoin Vault is the need to grow the project and attract more users and miners.Mining cryptocurrencies presents several challenges. High energy consumption is a significant issue due to the computational power needed, especially in regions with expensive electricity. Hardware costs are also high, with specialized equipment like ASICs for Bitcoin and GPUs for Ethereum being expensive to buy and maintain. Competition is fierce, with many miners vying for the same rewards, and difficulty adjustment mechanisms making it harder to mine new blocks as more miners join the network. The volatility of cryptocurrency prices can impact profitability, as can regulatory uncertainty and network congestion. Security risks, including those in mining pools, and environmental concerns related to energy consumption, are also challenges. Additionally, hardware obsolescence means miners must regularly upgrade their equipment to stay competitive. These challenges require careful consideration before investing in mining operations.To address at least some of those issues, Bitcoin Vault is proceeding with decentralization. Decentralization is a key principle of cryptocurrency, and it is important for several reasons. First, decentralization helps to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain. By distributing control over the network among many different participants, it becomes much more difficult for any single entity to manipulate the blockchain. Second, decentralization promotes innovation and competition. When power is concentrated in the hands of a few, it can stifle innovation and limit the potential for new ideas and technologies to emerge. Finally, decentralization helps to protect the privacy and autonomy of users. When control over the network is decentralized, users have more control over their own data and can be more confident that their transactions will remain private and secure.One of the benefits of joining the community of miners for projects like Bitcoin Vault is the functionality of merge mining. Merge mining allows miners to simultaneously mine multiple cryptocurrencies that use the same consensus mechanism. This can help to increase the profitability of mining and attract more miners to the project.

Core Scientific seals $100M deal with CoreWeave as miners diversify cash streams,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 20:03:23.956914,"Bitcoin miner Core Scientific seeks to diversify its revenue streams ahead of the upcoming halving. The company inked a deal with artificial intelligence startup CoreWeave to provide data center services, with potential revenue of more than $100 million. 
Core Scientific is leasing a Tier 3 data center in Austin, Texas, that formerly housed Hewlett Packard to host CoreWeave’s infrastructure. Under the terms of the contract, the miner will deliver up to 16 megawatts of capacity at its new Austin data center, expanding its business to include high-performance computing (HPC).
CoreWeave is an AI cloud computing company backed by Wall Street’s major financial firms, including Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Fidelity. The startup offers infrastructure for compute-intensive use cases, such as machine learning. At the end of December 2023, the company was valued at $7 billion.
“Our new data center in Austin will support CoreWeave’s near-term requirements while also expanding and diversifying Core Scientific’s hosting customer portfolio across two categories of high value compute: bitcoin mining and specialized GPU cloud compute,” said Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan in a statement. 
Related: What the Bitcoin halving means for the network’s energy consumption concerns
Core Scientific’s expansion of service offerings comes just a few weeks ahead of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, which will slash Bitcoin’s block reward revenue in half. The 2024 halving for Bitcoin — which follows the previous ones in 2020, 2016, and 2012 — will see the block reward for miners decrease from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. The purpose of the halving is to control Bitcoin’s inflation, reducing the supply of new coins over time.
While miners will see a considerable reduction in revenue, costs associated with the activity are likely to increase. According to an analysis from CoinShares, electricity costs per Bitcoin pre- and post-halving represent about 68% and 71% of miners’ total cost structure, respectively. The average cost of production post-halving for crypto miners is projected to be $37,856.

In 2023, Core Scientific became the largest publicly listed crypto mining company in North America after mining 19,274 BTC, worth $812 million. The miner recently emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the United States after a 13-month restructuring process to resolve $400 million in debt caused by declining BTC prices, rising energy costs, and debt tied to the bankrupt Celsius Network.

AI tokens surged over 30% in 24 hours, led by $NEAR, $RNDR, $FET, and $AGIX.
$RNDR hits an all-time high of $10.27, reflecting booming demand for decentralized GPU rendering.
Fetch AI ($FET) rallies 50% to $2.85, spotlighting autonomous agents’ role in automating the digital economy.

The AI tokens within the cryptocurrency market have increased incredibly over the last 24 hours. Tokens leading the charge include NEAR Protocol ($NEAR), Render Token ($RNDR), Fetch AI ($FET), Sleepless AI ($AI), and SingularityNET ($AGIX), with gains of 30% or more. This trend aligns with the rising interest and investment in the AI sector and the overwhelmingly bullish general market sentiment on the future of AI technologies in the blockchain space.
Substantial Gains Across the Board
NEAR Protocol, a blockchain platform that provides scalability, dApp, and smart contract development user-friendly features, has witnessed a remarkable price surge, reaching $6.09. At the time of writing, NEAR changed hands at $5.66, an increase of 26.89% from the intra-day low.

"Next Cryptocurrency To Explode Thursday, March 7 – Render, Sei, Fantom",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 20:03:27.781158,"
Every day, the crypto market emerges with a unique narrative. The crypto bull market recently encountered a pushback after the BTC price surpassed its ATH value. However, the current trends across the board make it apparent that altcoins are the next cryptocurrencies to explode as investors’ interest has turned in that direction.
There’s been a significant surge in the price of many altcoins, with AI and DePINs leading the way. Owing to the rising value of these cryptos, several traders believe there is a high chance that they’ll also follow the BTC trend, surpassing their ATH values before the end of the quarter.
Next Cryptocurrency To Explode 
As the altcoin season kicks off, it’s essential to note that assets in the AI sectors appear to earn more inflow. Many tokens like RNDR, FET, and AGIX have recorded double-digit price increases in the last 24 hours. Similarly, upcoming projects like Scotty the AI are increasingly gaining visibility. Today’s update provides a quick overview of the project and how to participate in the presale.
1. Fantom (FTM)
Fantom posted a 52-week high today after a 20% increase in price. Even though the trading volume of FTM today is considerably lower than the value recorded at the same time yesterday, the overall price action in the crypto market reflects on its price. Moreover, the progressively increasing price can be traced to the recent activity across its network.
FTM had increased social media exposure through its Fanthom Sonic mainnet launch. The upgrade comes with an improved Fantom Virtual Machine, which is said to be faster and executes better. Other activities, like the platform’s role at ETHDenver 2024, also gave it exposure that reflected its current trend.



With a price of $0.81 at the time of writing, FTM is only 10% away from breaking above its $0.91 resistance. If the token climbs above the price, it will likely witness a dramatic rally toward the $1.1 range. Ultimately, FTM’s chance of breaking its ATH at its current pace is relatively high.

Since the July 2023 Multichain exploit, Fantom Foundation’s management and legal team have been working tirelessly across multiple jurisdictions to chart a path forward that enables victims to partially recover assets lost. We have an important update in this regard.
After all… pic.twitter.com/pUxyalPdMD
— Fantom Foundation (@FantomFDN) March 4, 2024


Furthermore, one of the catalogs that might fuel the next phase of FTM’s price pump is the platform’s decision to work towards reducing the loss incurred from the 2023 exploit. In July of 2023, the Fantom network suffered significantly from the exploit on the Multichain bridge.
Fantom Foundation sought redress, which the Multichain Foundation refused to do, and they decided to take legal action against Multichain. The court gave the default victor to Fantom Foundation in the case as Multichain declined to respond, possibly leading to Fantom Foundation liquidating Multichain’s assets. According to the post on its blog, the proceeds will likely be used to compensate users who incurred losses from the exploit.
2. Scotty the AI (SCOTTY) 
In a decentralized economy, the probability of crime is relatively high. This situation is more evident in the crypto market, where many projects that go live are littered with fraudulent practices.





Thus, the community behind the Scotty the AI project envisions a safer cyberspace where anyone can trade cryptocurrency without the fear of scams. This narrative is embodied in the project’s mascot, Scotty. The idea is to build an AI watchdog that tracks and identifies flaws in projects or transactions.
The project is still in the works, and investors who are looking to invest in the artificial intelligence sector still have the opportunity to join the movement. The token has a presale price of  $0.0078, and over $3.3 million have been invested in the project.

💥Presale Update!💥

The SCOTTY team and community have more milestones before the token is listed on exchanges. Upon listing, there is a high chance that SCOTTY would record a significant pump in price due to the growing interest in the AI sector. Ultimately, investors can find additional images about the project on its presale page.

3. Render (RNDR)
Today, despite the recent pullback recorded in the market, RNDR pushed above the $10 mark, establishing a new ATH value. The sudden rise in value comes from its growing influence in the AI sector.
A recent example is its partnership with the emerging GPU project IONET, which aims to assemble over 10000 GPUs through decentralized tech. Generally, The advancement of Render in the artificial intelligence space has positioned it as a project to watch in the DePIN sector.



While its native token, RNDR, may appear to have achieved a significant increase in value, there’s more room for an increase. As the demand for GPU services increases, the services of platforms like Render will increase dramatically.

— io.net (@ionet_official) March 7, 2024


From the technical Analysis, most of the bullish indicators applied to its market data return bullish signals. Its MACD reasons show that the market is still very bullish on the RNDR token. Consequently, it might continue its ride above the $10 range.
In addition, the token in the last 24 hours recorded an increase of over 20% and a trading volume pump of over 180%. This trend reveals that the market is responding positively to its recent performance, which might be the fuel it needs to continue its upward ride. Ultimately, RNDR is one of the tokens to watch this season as the bullish trend funds flow into the Altcoins market.
4. Sei (SEI)
Despite being a highly volatile asset, SEI is on track to becoming one of the next cryptocurrencies to explode. In the last 24 hours, it has recorded over 12% price increase. The token’s price might cross the $1 mark before the end of the quarter. The increasing activities in the network and the growing use cases would likely be the catalyst to trigger the price action.



Furthermore, the SEI community should look forward to increasing activities as the platform moves into NFTs. The initiative comes after its partnership with the Akita Inu Preservation Society. The partnership opens more doors to the project in Japan. With that, SEI would like more use cases in the metaverse, art, culture, and other blockchains. Thus, the growing demand for the token will likely influence its future performance.

The Sei community is thrilled to work alongside @MetaAkita, a leading initiative from the renowned Akita Inu Preservation Society 🐕
Sei is continuing to build culturally significant relationships in Japan and with this Seiyans can anticipate adorable NFTs and a dedicated Akita… pic.twitter.com/vN1UMj6AgG
— Sei 🔴💨 (@SeiNetwork) March 5, 2024


Even though SEI declined consistently from mid-last month until recently, it found support at $0.7. Hence, the likelihood of rallying to a new ATH value is relatively high. Moreover, the SEI RSI reading is closer to the oversold side. The value signals that the bulls might soon have the upper hand.
Similarly, other indicators applied to the SEI chart reveal further bullish signals. Readings from its Bull Bear Power indicator also returned a -0.0158, which is also bullish. On the other hand, short-term moving averages applied to the chart show that SEI may be bearish in the short term but bullish in the long run. Hence, it is essential to take precautions and research the asset further to identify the best strategies to apply.

Stock Market: The CAC 40 falls back towards its infernal lows!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 20:03:28.992791,"The CAC 40 is enacting a scene that seems pulled straight from a Greek tragedy. Instead of ascending to Olympian heights, the flagship index of the Paris stock exchange is plunging once again into hellish meanders, a descent orchestrated to the tune of the global economy’s uncertain heartbeat.
Teleperformance: The Faltering Icon on the Stock Market
In the heart of this financial storm, Teleperformance, once a beacon of the pandemic economy, wobbles under the assaults of a merciless market. This is happening as the market holds its breath.




Its stock, once perched on the pedestal of 400 euros, now seems to be sinking in quicksand, having lost three-quarters of its value since 2022. This debacle, punctuated by an almost theatrical 29% drop on February 28th, could symbolize the end of an era for traditional call centers.
But the story of Teleperformance is not only about a fall; it is also about a struggle against the windmills of artificial intelligence (AI).
Faced with the fears of a market rattled by the promises and threats of AI, Teleperformance’s management is playing the card of cautious optimism. They remind us that adaptation and innovation have always been the guiding principles of their strategy, demonstrating a refusal to succumb to the prevailing pessimism.
Between Innovation and Adaptation
Innovation at Teleperformance is not just for show; it plays a leading role. With its 600 analysts and developers, not to mention the 25,000 “robots” already on stage, the company seems ready to embrace the era of generative AI. This technological fleet, far from replacing humans, aims to enrich customer experience and elevate the quality of service.
The AI challenge is not seen as a threat but an opportunity for reinvention. In this context, Teleperformance positions itself not just as a survivor of technological evolution, but also as a pioneer in content moderation and the fight against deepfakes, promising an invaluable added value to its clients.
The outlook for 2024, although cautious, charts a path for a future where growth, albeit modest, is still on the agenda. In a capricious macroeconomic environment, the goal of an organic revenue growth between 2% and 4% reflects measured but undeniable optimism.
The governance of Teleperformance, in full transformation, is laying the groundwork for a new era of leadership. With a planned separation of the roles of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer by 2026, the company appears to be laying the foundations for a more agile structure suited to future challenges.
The story of Teleperformance and the CAC 40, with its ups and downs, reminds us that the stock market is a living entity, breathing to the rhythm of innovations, crises, and reinventions. While the descent into shadowy depths seems to be the narrative of the moment, history teaches us that after the fall comes the rise. On the other hand, the BRICS might cause a recession in the American economy.

"WIF Whales Gorge On SMOG Token Amid Meme Coin Mania, Binance Listing In View After New All-Time Highs",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 20:03:30.071584,"
Solana-based meme coin $SMOG’s price powered 60% higher overnight as the Asian buying frenzy continues and rumors of a Binance listing abound.   
The dragon coin with a monster 35% of total supply being airdropped is firing up. Its price keeps breaking new ground as its parabolic run-up continues. $SMOG token is valued at $0.28 and could soon be trading at $1 if the present rate of appreciation continues.   
Meme coins are outperforming all other altcoin sectors, and beating bitcoin too, as investors search out tenbagger returns. Rare in the world of stocks, 10x gains are far from a rarity in the meme coin space, as $SMOG’s performance shows.  
Over the past 24 hours $SMOG was the top gainer overall. It was the third-placed overall gainer among the top 500 coins over a seven-day period and is a top trending coin on various trading sites – it reached No.3 on Dextools for instance. 


It has now become a habit of see ATH everyday… #SMOGSOAR$SMOG#ATH pic.twitter.com/jdDvFDmNls— Minesh Gurung (@gurung_minesh) March 7, 2024
 
 
And if exchange listing rumors are to be believed, that ‘kill the zero’ moment could come much sooner.  


   
 

  Dogwifhat and $MYRO tokens recently listed on Binance, helping to propel both of them to an all-time high price. Now it looks like the same could be in store for $SMOG.
 

   
    
If it is not Binance then it could be another top tier exchange like OKX or KuCoin for example.  
Either way, as the famed trading aphorism would have it, “the trend is your friend”, so don’t fight it at this point – see the 1-hour candles on the $SMOG price chart below:  



  
WIF Whales Queue Up To Buy $SMOG  
Interestingly it appears that Dogwifhat whales are leading the charge that’s pushing the $SMOG price higher.   
In a cheeky move to encourage more WIF whales to join the gold rush, the $SMOG team has set up a Swap WIF for SMOG quest on Zealy. Meanwhile, to get the party started, $SMOG is being airdropped to every WIF wallet.   
According to the quest page, XP will be allocated based on the dollar value of the $WIF swaps to $SMOG made. In essence then, the more you swap the bigger the XP earnings, which will of course appeal to deep-pocketed WIF whales.  
Here are the full instructions to earn the XP airdrop points:   

Swap $WIF to $SMOG from Birdeye, Jupiter or another DEX  
Before the end of Phase 1 of Airdrop, XP will be allocated based on amount of $WIF swapped to $SMOG  
To complete, users must swap $WIF to $SMOG from a DEX  
Users must submit a screenshot with the completed transaction  
Once completed, users will earn XP allocated based on amount owned 
  
Any whales, or others, with queries can reach out to the team on Telegram or Discord.  
Mind you, it is not just the WIF crowd that is hoovering up $SMOG. Here is a table of buys valued at over $10k coming in from SOL holders:  



  
$SMOG Market Cap Blasts Past $200 million, But There’s Billions More Up For Grabs  
$SMOG has hit a market cap valuation of $213 million, amassed a staggering 54k token holders in no time, and is now commanding a 24-hour trading volume of almost $7 million. The fully diluted market cap has swollen to $392 million.  
Still, those achievements notwithstanding, there are probably billions of dollars sitting on the table for investors in the know that have stumbled upon this gem. A 5x price surge to take the token past $1 billion market cap might be just the beginning for this new Shiba Inu. $SHIB has a market cap of $19 billion.  
The loveable dragon token has caught the eye of Asian buyers in this year of the dragon, but market participants in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions as well as the Americas are not going to be left behind as money floods in from all directions.  
What’s more, after achieving a new all-time high above $69,000, bitcoin may have entered a period of consolidation, providing investors with an opening to seek out alpha in altcoins, and in particular among the meme coins.  
$SMOG’s rally has produced a 22,543% gain for early buyers, since it launched on February 7, according to DEX Screener data.  



  
$SMOG can currently be bought through decentralized exchanges such as Jupiter. SOL tokens have been flowing out of centralized exchanges into non-custodial wallets as investors look to enter trades in fair launch tokens such as $SMOG, which for now can only be bought on DEXs.  
New meme coins running on Ethereum are also getting attention. However, some buyers are deterred by the high fees, which at busy times are north of $200 as Ethereum rockets in price. $ETH is currently valued at $3,814 – within spitting distance of $4k, while $SOL is outperforming it, up 7% at $139.95.  
For sure the hot money is finding a home on the Solana network and SMOG is one of the main beneficiaries.  
Perhaps even more significant for the longevity of the $SMOG bull run is the way, over the past 48 hours or so, it is outrunning older meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, down 7 and 10% respectively at the start of the US session.   



  
How To Buy Smog Token, Join the SMOG Airdrop Campaign  
To take part in the SMOG airdrop prospective participants will need to avail themselves of a Solana-compatible – Phantom is a popular pick.  
Buyers can then head over to Jupiter DEX or Birdeye to buy $SMOG, using SOL, USDT, or BONK. Investors can also buy directly on the Smog website, where you can buy and stake on the Ethereum chain to claim a 10% discount and earn 42% APY.  
The full airdrop campaign offering of quests is available on the Zealy platform, where the completion of tasks such as signing up for socials and trading the token will enable holders to boost their airdrop allocation.   
The community can also win $5,000 worth of $SMOG in the weekly giveaway competition that ends every Friday at 5pm UTC. So there really is all to play for with $SMOG.  
Participants can also boost their chance of being selected for the Loyal Chosen as part of the gamification aspect of the campaign, where mystery is the order of the day and bonuses and rewards lurk in the dragon’s lair, waiting to be captured.  
YouTube crypto tipster Jacob Crypto Bury rates $SMOG as one of his top eight meme coins to buy now.




    
Sign up to the Smog community on X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram to keep abreast of project developments. As the altcoin season kicks into gear, it is meme coins that are leading the pack and Solana-based variants in particular.   
The marketing lingo talks about ‘one meme coin to rule them all’ and that might be exactly what new holders could be buying into, as $SMOG fulfils its mission to be the next Shiba Inu, Pepe or Bonk.

Philippines to Ban Major Crypto Exchange After MiTrade and OctaFX?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 20:03:32.131032,"Amid the sharp growth in the adoption of cryptocurrencies, several national governments are formulating strategies and laws to deal with fraud, theft, scams, and Ponzi schemes to name a few. 
A regional media outlet in the Philippines recently wrote, “The National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) of the nation has started blocking access to such websites that offer investment products without a proper license.” 
The harsh action of the commission has stirred the crypto industry in the Philippines. Official websites of crypto exchanges MiTrade and OctaFX have been affected by the action. Users in the island nation are not able to access these websites from one of the most prominent internet service providers.
An order of the NTC dated February 21, 2024, states that the internet service providers in the region are advised to block access to the MiTrade website and applications as it has violated the law issued by the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Emilio Aquino, the Chairperson and CEO of the Philippines SEC, says that the recent action of the NTC is appreciable; it will also help the country to prevent scams and fraud.
He added, “The SEC and NTC will continue to work closely together to take similar actions on other platforms facilitating illegal investment-taking activities and other predatory financial schemes.” 
The back-to-back actions of the NTC reflect its intentions to safeguard citizens from investment and other types of possible financial fraud. The SEC could soon ban Binance in the nation. 
In a statement of February 28, 2024, the spokesperson of the Philippines SEC has highlighted that the commission is investigating the possible effects of the Binance ban in the region. Inquirer reported that structural changes in the SEC have caused a delay in the regulator’s decision on Binance.
“The SEC is currently evaluating all possible ramifications of the blocking, including implications to Filipino customer funds. We are also working with other government agencies on the procedure of restraining unregistered entities’ operations in the Philippines, the spokesperson noted.” 
SECs of Different Nations Vital for the Crypto Sector!
Several cryptocurrency exchanges have been sued by multiple national financial regulators. Most of the time, the commission/regulator files a case against the exchanges for selling unregistered securities and operating without a license. 
However, the authorities regulating securities of several nations have favored cryptocurrencies. When it comes to regulating crypto, the United States SEC is one of the most strict regulators globally.
Market Price Update 
The market capitalization of the crypto sector has surged over 55% in the past three months. As of writing, the market cap was $2.52 Trillion with an intraday decline of 0.21%. 
Bitcoin, the market leader, has grown over 55% in the past 30 days. At the time of writing, BTC price was 67,010.
The 4th Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April 2024. In this event, the mining reward for validators will be divided into half of what was earlier rewarded. In the past 52 weeks, the price of Bitcoin was trading near its all time high.","['UTED', 'SEC', 'APRIL', 'CEO', 'TRL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9f3b635539f471eb408f5/

Its stock, once perched on the pedestal of 400 euros, now seems to be sinking in quicksand, having lost three-quarters of its value since 2022. This debacle, punctuated by an almost theatrical 29% drop on February 28th, could symbolize the end of an era for traditional call centers.
But the story of Teleperformance is not only about a fall; it is also about a struggle against the windmills of artificial intelligence (AI).
Faced with the fears of a market rattled by the promises and threats of AI, Teleperformance’s management is playing the card of cautious optimism. They remind us that adaptation and innovation have always been the guiding principles of their strategy, demonstrating a refusal to succumb to the prevailing pessimism.
Between Innovation and Adaptation
Innovation at Teleperformance is not just for show; it plays a leading role. With its 600 analysts and developers, not to mention the 25,000 “robots” already on stage, the company seems ready to embrace the era of generative AI. This technological fleet, far from replacing humans, aims to enrich customer experience and elevate the quality of service.
The AI challenge is not seen as a threat but an opportunity for reinvention. In this context, Teleperformance positions itself not just as a survivor of technological evolution, but also as a pioneer in content moderation and the fight against deepfakes, promising an invaluable added value to its clients.
The outlook for 2024, although cautious, charts a path for a future where growth, albeit modest, is still on the agenda. In a capricious macroeconomic environment, the goal of an organic revenue growth between 2% and 4% reflects measured but undeniable optimism.
The governance of Teleperformance, in full transformation, is laying the groundwork for a new era of leadership. With a planned separation of the roles of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer by 2026, the company appears to be laying the foundations for a more agile structure suited to future challenges.
The story of Teleperformance and the CAC 40, with its ups and downs, reminds us that the stock market is a living entity, breathing to the rhythm of innovations, crises, and reinventions. While the descent into shadowy depths seems to be the narrative of the moment, history teaches us that after the fall comes the rise. On the other hand, the BRICS might cause a recession in the American economy.

"WIF Whales Gorge On SMOG Token Amid Meme Coin Mania, Binance Listing In View After New All-Time Highs",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 20:03:47.405414,"
Solana-based meme coin $SMOG’s price powered 60% higher overnight as the Asian buying frenzy continues and rumors of a Binance listing abound.   
The dragon coin with a monster 35% of total supply being airdropped is firing up. Its price keeps breaking new ground as its parabolic run-up continues. $SMOG token is valued at $0.28 and could soon be trading at $1 if the present rate of appreciation continues.   
Meme coins are outperforming all other altcoin sectors, and beating bitcoin too, as investors search out tenbagger returns. Rare in the world of stocks, 10x gains are far from a rarity in the meme coin space, as $SMOG’s performance shows.  
Over the past 24 hours $SMOG was the top gainer overall. It was the third-placed overall gainer among the top 500 coins over a seven-day period and is a top trending coin on various trading sites – it reached No.3 on Dextools for instance. 


It has now become a habit of see ATH everyday… #SMOGSOAR$SMOG#ATH pic.twitter.com/jdDvFDmNls— Minesh Gurung (@gurung_minesh) March 7, 2024
 
 
And if exchange listing rumors are to be believed, that ‘kill the zero’ moment could come much sooner.  


   
 

  Dogwifhat and $MYRO tokens recently listed on Binance, helping to propel both of them to an all-time high price. Now it looks like the same could be in store for $SMOG.
 

   
    
If it is not Binance then it could be another top tier exchange like OKX or KuCoin for example.  
Either way, as the famed trading aphorism would have it, “the trend is your friend”, so don’t fight it at this point – see the 1-hour candles on the $SMOG price chart below:  



  
WIF Whales Queue Up To Buy $SMOG  
Interestingly it appears that Dogwifhat whales are leading the charge that’s pushing the $SMOG price higher.   
In a cheeky move to encourage more WIF whales to join the gold rush, the $SMOG team has set up a Swap WIF for SMOG quest on Zealy. Meanwhile, to get the party started, $SMOG is being airdropped to every WIF wallet.   
According to the quest page, XP will be allocated based on the dollar value of the $WIF swaps to $SMOG made. In essence then, the more you swap the bigger the XP earnings, which will of course appeal to deep-pocketed WIF whales.  
Here are the full instructions to earn the XP airdrop points:   

Swap $WIF to $SMOG from Birdeye, Jupiter or another DEX  
Before the end of Phase 1 of Airdrop, XP will be allocated based on amount of $WIF swapped to $SMOG  
To complete, users must swap $WIF to $SMOG from a DEX  
Users must submit a screenshot with the completed transaction  
Once completed, users will earn XP allocated based on amount owned 
  
Any whales, or others, with queries can reach out to the team on Telegram or Discord.  
Mind you, it is not just the WIF crowd that is hoovering up $SMOG. Here is a table of buys valued at over $10k coming in from SOL holders:  



  
$SMOG Market Cap Blasts Past $200 million, But There’s Billions More Up For Grabs  
$SMOG has hit a market cap valuation of $213 million, amassed a staggering 54k token holders in no time, and is now commanding a 24-hour trading volume of almost $7 million. The fully diluted market cap has swollen to $392 million.  
Still, those achievements notwithstanding, there are probably billions of dollars sitting on the table for investors in the know that have stumbled upon this gem. A 5x price surge to take the token past $1 billion market cap might be just the beginning for this new Shiba Inu. $SHIB has a market cap of $19 billion.  
The loveable dragon token has caught the eye of Asian buyers in this year of the dragon, but market participants in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions as well as the Americas are not going to be left behind as money floods in from all directions.  
What’s more, after achieving a new all-time high above $69,000, bitcoin may have entered a period of consolidation, providing investors with an opening to seek out alpha in altcoins, and in particular among the meme coins.  
$SMOG’s rally has produced a 22,543% gain for early buyers, since it launched on February 7, according to DEX Screener data.  



  
$SMOG can currently be bought through decentralized exchanges such as Jupiter. SOL tokens have been flowing out of centralized exchanges into non-custodial wallets as investors look to enter trades in fair launch tokens such as $SMOG, which for now can only be bought on DEXs.  
New meme coins running on Ethereum are also getting attention. However, some buyers are deterred by the high fees, which at busy times are north of $200 as Ethereum rockets in price. $ETH is currently valued at $3,814 – within spitting distance of $4k, while $SOL is outperforming it, up 7% at $139.95.  
For sure the hot money is finding a home on the Solana network and SMOG is one of the main beneficiaries.  
Perhaps even more significant for the longevity of the $SMOG bull run is the way, over the past 48 hours or so, it is outrunning older meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, down 7 and 10% respectively at the start of the US session.   



  
How To Buy Smog Token, Join the SMOG Airdrop Campaign  
To take part in the SMOG airdrop prospective participants will need to avail themselves of a Solana-compatible – Phantom is a popular pick.  
Buyers can then head over to Jupiter DEX or Birdeye to buy $SMOG, using SOL, USDT, or BONK. Investors can also buy directly on the Smog website, where you can buy and stake on the Ethereum chain to claim a 10% discount and earn 42% APY.  
The full airdrop campaign offering of quests is available on the Zealy platform, where the completion of tasks such as signing up for socials and trading the token will enable holders to boost their airdrop allocation.   
The community can also win $5,000 worth of $SMOG in the weekly giveaway competition that ends every Friday at 5pm UTC. So there really is all to play for with $SMOG.  
Participants can also boost their chance of being selected for the Loyal Chosen as part of the gamification aspect of the campaign, where mystery is the order of the day and bonuses and rewards lurk in the dragon’s lair, waiting to be captured.  
YouTube crypto tipster Jacob Crypto Bury rates $SMOG as one of his top eight meme coins to buy now.




    
Sign up to the Smog community on X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram to keep abreast of project developments. As the altcoin season kicks into gear, it is meme coins that are leading the pack and Solana-based variants in particular.   
The marketing lingo talks about ‘one meme coin to rule them all’ and that might be exactly what new holders could be buying into, as $SMOG fulfils its mission to be the next Shiba Inu, Pepe or Bonk.

Philippines to Ban Major Crypto Exchange After MiTrade and OctaFX?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 20:03:49.333322,"Amid the sharp growth in the adoption of cryptocurrencies, several national governments are formulating strategies and laws to deal with fraud, theft, scams, and Ponzi schemes to name a few. 
A regional media outlet in the Philippines recently wrote, “The National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) of the nation has started blocking access to such websites that offer investment products without a proper license.” 
The harsh action of the commission has stirred the crypto industry in the Philippines. Official websites of crypto exchanges MiTrade and OctaFX have been affected by the action. Users in the island nation are not able to access these websites from one of the most prominent internet service providers.
An order of the NTC dated February 21, 2024, states that the internet service providers in the region are advised to block access to the MiTrade website and applications as it has violated the law issued by the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Emilio Aquino, the Chairperson and CEO of the Philippines SEC, says that the recent action of the NTC is appreciable; it will also help the country to prevent scams and fraud.
He added, “The SEC and NTC will continue to work closely together to take similar actions on other platforms facilitating illegal investment-taking activities and other predatory financial schemes.” 
The back-to-back actions of the NTC reflect its intentions to safeguard citizens from investment and other types of possible financial fraud. The SEC could soon ban Binance in the nation. 
In a statement of February 28, 2024, the spokesperson of the Philippines SEC has highlighted that the commission is investigating the possible effects of the Binance ban in the region. Inquirer reported that structural changes in the SEC have caused a delay in the regulator’s decision on Binance.
“The SEC is currently evaluating all possible ramifications of the blocking, including implications to Filipino customer funds. We are also working with other government agencies on the procedure of restraining unregistered entities’ operations in the Philippines, the spokesperson noted.” 
SECs of Different Nations Vital for the Crypto Sector!
Several cryptocurrency exchanges have been sued by multiple national financial regulators. Most of the time, the commission/regulator files a case against the exchanges for selling unregistered securities and operating without a license. 
However, the authorities regulating securities of several nations have favored cryptocurrencies. When it comes to regulating crypto, the United States SEC is one of the most strict regulators globally.
Market Price Update 
The market capitalization of the crypto sector has surged over 55% in the past three months. As of writing, the market cap was $2.52 Trillion with an intraday decline of 0.21%. 
Bitcoin, the market leader, has grown over 55% in the past 30 days. At the time of writing, BTC price was 67,010.
The 4th Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April 2024. In this event, the mining reward for validators will be divided into half of what was earlier rewarded. In the past 52 weeks, the price of Bitcoin was trading near its all time high.","['UTED', 'SEC', 'APRIL', 'CEO', 'TRL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9f3b635539f471eb408f5/

Fed Chairman Powell’s speech text today didn’t have many different statements from previous ones, but he made some unexpected announcements. At the time of writing, he touched on CBDCs and many other critical issues. Fed members generally aim to shape their positions in the next 7 days depending on future data.
Remarks by Fed Chairman
Powell did not make a direct statement about cryptocurrencies but said it is too early for a digital fiat currency. He also warned that we might see bankruptcies in small banks. Here are the important headlines from his remarks;


We are not close to recommending or adopting any kind of central bank digital currency.
As the labor market cools, we have seen and will see food inflation stabilize.
The US economy is healthy, growing at a sustainable and robust pace.
Different types of insurance have recently been a significant source of inflation.
The housing market is in a very difficult situation. We should see the housing market begin to recover as interest rates and inflation fall, but this will not solve the long-term problem.
When interest rates normalize, the underlying housing shortage will continue to exert upward pressure on prices.
If the economy goes as expected, we think that the restrictive policy stance will begin to be carefully lifted within this year.
I expect bank failures from CRE. However, not big banks, there are smaller and medium-sized banks with the highest risk.
I think we are in the right place regarding policy. I am waiting to be more certain, we are not far from it.

Fed member Mester also shared her concern that inflation could be persistent this year, although she mentioned that cuts could be made if the economy meets forecasts.

Big Solana pump coming in? Pantera play $250M SOL buy plan,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-07 20:03:51.400382,"Solana (SOL), one of the biggest gainers of 2023, is continuing its positive upward swing in 2024. SOL’s ongoing rally has landed it on the radar of Pantera Capital. Reports are making rounds that the asset manager is seeking funds from large investors for the Pantera Solana Fund. Pantera’s bet on Solana 
According to a report, Pantera Capital is looking to buy $250 million worth of Solana (SOL) tokens from the estate of the bankrupt digital asset exchange FTX. It is interesting to see such a big move from the crypto-focused asset manager with assets of $5.2 billion.
The asset manager is reportedly offering investors the opportunity to buy SOL tokens at a discounted rate of 39% below the 30-day average price or for $59.95. This option is part of Pantera’s strategy to capitalize on the potential to acquire SOL tokens at a reduced price from the FTX estate.
In exchange for the discounted purchase option, investors must agree to a vesting period lasting up to four years. This extended vesting period is a mechanism to prevent immediate selling pressure on SOL tokens.
According to Pantera’s pitch document, the FTX estate holds approx 41.1 million Solana coins. The holding is valued at $5.4 billion as of the latest market close. However, this represents around 10% of the total SOL token supply. 650% surge 
SOL has recorded a massive surge of almost 650% in the past 12 months. This price jump is making the token an attractive asset for the FTX estate to raise funds for creditors. The current price is nearly four times higher than its value when FTX faced challenges in November 2022.
Solana price is up by 11% in the last 24 hours. SOL is trading at an average price of $142, at the press time.
FTX’s co-founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, a key figure in the Solana network, is awaiting sentencing on multiple counts of fraud. The FTX estate’s involvement with Solana adds complexity to the situation.
Pantera aimed to close the fund by the end of February. While the firm raised some money by the deadline, the exact figure remains undisclosed. Investors were required to commit a minimum of $25 million each to participate. Pantera plans to charge a management fee of 0.75% along with a performance cut of 10% for participants in the fund.

Ethereum’s growth dips as traders eye new eco-friendly crypto,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 20:03:52.423568," Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. 
Despite Ethereum’s recent 4.32% drop, the eco-friendly ICO eTukTuk hits $1.7M in presale with experts predicting significant returns.
Ethereum has fallen by 4.32% today hours despite rallying to highs of $3.8K yesterday. However, the new ICO eTukTuk is progressing in its presale as it surges past $1.7 million.
ETH price slumps but bulls fight back
Ethereum enjoyed notable demand over the past week, rising from $3.2K to $3.8K yesterday. However, a decisive sell-off pushed it to lows of $3.3K, just north of its price last week.
The move was triggered by a flush of leveraged long positions on Ethereum and mirrored price action across the market.
As per CoinGlass data, $199 million of ETH has been liquidated over the past 24 hours. However, its open interest has jumped 3.66%. 
In comparison, the open interest for other top cryptos is down. For instance, Solana and Dogecoin’s are down over 16%, while Bitcoin’s is down 0.34%.

The optimism is also evident in market predictions, with CrediBull Crypto speculating that ETH is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the coming weeks. 
“It’s no surprise that ETH may outperform BTC, at least in the short term. For now, I think we have the makings of a local bottom on ETH/BTC, and I am looking for at least a 10% move to the upside here as BTC consolidates at the highs,” He wrote.
The analyst then displayed a price chart showing ETH establishing solid support against BTC, with an annotated trajectory showing an uptrend.

Similarly, Mathew Hyland believes that ETH will outperform BTC, noting the possibility of Ethereum spot ETFs adding significant price appreciation potential.
Alongside the ETH/BTC price chart, Mathew explained, “ETH/BTC has held this range despite BTC ETF getting approved, BTC having its largest monthly candle ever, BTC breaking ATHs.”
He continued, “There are 79 days until ETH ETFs. Every day that passes becomes more favorable to an upside break and less favorable to a downside break.”

Meanwhile, Rekt Capital anticiapates altcoins to take over following Bitcoin’s all-time high, referencing an “altcoin hype cycle.”
The analyst says this will occur in four waves throughout 2024, with each becoming “more impressive as the bull market progresses.”

Ethereum is the leading altcoin by market cap, presenting significant upside potential. However, Rekt Capital’s altcoin hype cycle theory would also immensely benefit newer and lower-market-cap altcoins.

Bitcoin Value Requires 5% Decrease to Obliterate $2B of BTC Long Holds,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 20:03:54.579768,"Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC) could liquidate $2 billion of BTC long positions with a $3,000 drop from current levels.
The current market situation is interesting, with traders making significant bets on BTC’s price direction.

Bitcoin (BTC) stands on the edge of a significant shift in the market.
A mere $3,000 drop from current levels could trigger a liquidation of $2 billion in BTC long positions.
The Current Market Scenario
BTC experienced a swift drop of $10,000 in a few hours following new all-time highs on March 5.
However, it has since rebounded, creating a fascinating situation on exchanges.
Traders are wagering heavily on both sides of the current spot price, which was moving towards $67,400 at the time of writing after the March 7 Wall Street open.
Data shows that a dip to $64,286 could liquidate $2 billion of long BTC positions.
A further drop to $60,000 could lead to the liquidation of $2.33 billion of longs, a figure still higher than the bounce zone of the $10,000 red daily candle.
Conversely, breaking the latest all-time highs of $69,210 could liquidate around $1.31 billion of BTC shorts, with the tally hitting $1.57 billion at $70,000.
Market Volatility and Predictions
The latest Wall Street opening saw a swift $1,000 move up and down for BTC/USD within minutes.
This volatility has led to some traders referring to the current market as “volatility city”.

Travala Launches Bitcoin Cashback Program for Elite Travelers,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 20:03:55.756553,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Travala Launches Bitcoin Cashback Program for Elite Travelers
Crypto-friendly travel agency Travala is launching a Bitcoin cashback program as a desirable reward mechanism for high-level travelers. A shared announcement summarizes Travala’s new reward program available to users who unlock the Smart Diamond tier of the loyalty reward program operated by the AVA Foundation’s blockchain platform.
Travala Team Makes Noteworthy Move
Travala CEO Juan Otero emphasized that Bitcoin‘s position as the most recognized cryptocurrency, along with its limited supply and status as a scarce crypto asset, are driving forces behind the new cashback program. Otero stated the following:

“Bitcoin is here to stay and has become more attractive to mainstream audiences, especially after the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.”

Otero added that offering Bitcoin cashback rewards for travel bookings enhances the appeal of using cryptocurrency for everyday payments. Travala also confirmed that rewards are deposited into the member’s account within 24 hours after a trip is completed. Members have full authority over how to use their Bitcoin rewards, whether for payment on other travel products on the platform or withdrawal to an external wallet, exchange, or platform.
Bitcoin is one of the top three payment methods used on Travala, and Bitcoin payments account for approximately 9% of travel bookings made on the platform. Travelers spent over 5 million dollars in Bitcoin on the platform for flights, hotels, and events in 2023. However, it should be noted that users must own a Travel Tiger NFT and deposit 2,500 AVA tokens to activate their Smart Diamond membership, adding an element of exclusivity to Travala’s Bitcoin cashback plan.
Travala and Blockchain Initiatives
Considering that only 1,000 Travel Tiger NFTs are available, a limited number of travelers may be eligible for the reward program. The NFTs consist of randomly generated utility collections within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Market data from OpenSea shows that the floor price for a Travel Tiger is 2.6 Ethereum, valued at approximately $9,800 at the time of publication.

Travala is also drawing attention to crypto-based cashback programs as potential alternatives to traditional Web2-based programs. The company claims that the use of Bitcoin can help reduce fees associated with traditional payment rails for cashback providers and decrease the risk of chargeback fraud.
Travala’s CEO believes that Bitcoin rewards can attract new users to the Web3 ecosystem through Bitcoin and AVA reward programs. The AVA Foundation uses its native AVA token to distribute cashback and loyalty rewards, payment discounts, and gated access benefits on its blockchain-based reward platform.

Smog Price Prediction: SMOG Explodes 477% In A Month As Solana Competitors BONK And WIF Languish And This New AI Meme Coin Soars Towards $4 ...,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 20:03:57.056424,"The Smog price has skyrocketed more than 477% in the last month to trade at $0.281 as of 8:05 a.m. EST as investors scoop up as much of the Solana meme coin as possible.
Meanwhile, other Solana meme coins such as Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) saw their prices fall in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows that BONK registered a 12% 24-hour loss, while WIF saw its price drop more than 9% over the past day.
The Smog Price Attempts To Break Resistance

4-hour chart for SMOG/USDT (Source: TradingView)
The Smog price is attempting to overcome the resistance level at $0.2862. Should the crypto close a 4-hour candle above this threshold in the next 24 hours, then it may have the foundation needed to keep rising in the short term.
However, a rejection from the $0.2862 may expose the crypto to the risk of correcting down to the immediate support level at $0.2134 in the following 48 hours. Continued sell pressure at this point could then drag the Smog price all the way down to $0.1597 in the short term.
Technical Indicators Suggest The Smog Price May Keep Climbing
Technical indicators on SMOG’s 4-hour chart suggest any potential correction in the meme coin’s price may be a liquidity building move before another leg up. Both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are flagging bullish on the 4-hour chart, suggesting the crypto’s price may continue to rise in the coming days.
The MACD line is breaking away above the MACD Signal line. Traders generally see this as a sign that a crypto is in a bullish trend. The increasing gap between the two lines may signal that SMOG’s bullish trend is growing stronger as well.
In addition to this, the RSI indicator shows that the Smog price has a lot of bullish strength, as the RSI is above 50. Although the current reading of 77 may suggest the crypto is overbought, potentially leading to a correction, it is not unusual for a crypto to remain overbought for extended periods of time when it is pumping.
While the Smog price looks set to keep rising in the short term, investors are scrambling to buy into Scotty the AI, as its presale races towards $4 million.
A Meme Coin Taking Cyber Criminals Head On
Scotty the AI is an AI-powered meme coin that aims to protect investors in the expanding digital asset realm. With its sophisticated AI models, it is able to analyze countless lines of code to identify any potential security threats or software bugs that may lead to a loss of funds for unsuspecting investors.

The crypto community already has two cutting edge AI tools at its disposal within the Scotty the AI ecosystem. First is the project’s flagship offering, an AI-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) called Scotty Swap.
 What sets this platform apart from others is its ability to inspect the underlying code of transactions that it facilitates. Should it discover anything suspicious in the smart contracts’s code, or any other element of the swap transaction, it will send a notification to the user before executing the swap.
The second product on offer through the AI meme coin’s ecosystem is an innovative AI-powered chatbot by the name of Scotty Chat. This neat chatbot is able to act as a guide to the Web3 space, and answer any related questions users may have.
Investors Prepare For Potential 100X Returns
Investors are buying into Scotty the AI at a rapid pace, as shown by a presale that is fast-approaching the $4 million milestone. The altcoin’s clever positioning in both the vibrant meme coin sector and the booming AI crypto space may be one of the main factors that has investors excited. 
There is also a lucrative staking program that offers up to 57% in annual rewards for presale investors.

🚨 ScottyTheAi # 1 memecoin of 2024

— Scotty The Ai (@ScottyThe_Ai) March 7, 2024


All investors will need to do to gain access to these rewards is buy Scotty the AI’s native token, SCOTTY, through the project’s official website. 
The token is currently selling for $0.00805 and can be bought using MATIC, BNB, ETH, USDT or bank card. However, purchases made using BNB and MATIC will not be eligible for the project’s staking rewards. Investors will want to hurry though, as SCOTTY’s price is set to increase in subsequent presale rounds.
SCOTTY can be purchased here.

Investors have a better chance of identifying the following cryptocurrencies poised for significant growth among upcoming meme token projects. With that in mind, investors should explore the potential of Meme Kombat.
The project team and its community have successfully conducted a remarkable presale offering, with millions of dollars committed. With the presale ended and Season One set to commence, during which 11 memes will face off, the anticipation surrounding the token is at its peak. This article delves into updates on the project and its prospects.
New and Best Meme Coins to Buy Now
Over the past 30 days, $SMI has exhibited an impressive 81.80% increase, surpassing Ethereum by 11.03% and Bitcoin by 17.88%. The token has experienced 23 green days within this timeframe and is trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).
The crypto market has deviated from its usual trajectory in recent developments, experiencing a downturn over the past two days. Following brief explosive gains that propelled the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high value of $69,000, it subsequently underwent a significant pullback.
This event led to a substantial decline in crypto prices and liquidated over 750 million across the board. The impact of the price decline has extended to altcoins, with meme coins also being affected. At present, analysts express uncertainty regarding the potential trajectory of this trend.
1. SafeMoon Inu (SMI)
SafeMoon Inu is a smart ERC20 token launched fairly and is believed to have potential beyond the moon. It positions itself as a community-driven meme and gaming token with unique features that distinguish it in the crypto landscape. Launched on May 13, 2021, by early community members worldwide, the project incorporates an Anti-PaperHand system, distributing 2% of every transaction to holders, providing incentives and rewards for long-term commitment.
SafeMoon Inu is currently developing SMI Play to offer its users more utilities. This innovative development is a crypto gaming platform incorporating play-to-earn dynamics and in-game NFTs. The project’s flagship game, “Moonshot Voyage,” is a top-view looter shooter, providing a glimpse into the broader gaming ecosystem in the pipeline.

The project also includes an NFT platform that empowers users to earn, purchase, collect, trade, melt, and sell Non-Fungible Tokens. Its robust Marketplace offers many items available for sale or obtainable for free.
This multi-dimensional approach aims to provide additional benefits to SMI token holders, enhancing the utility of the meme coin. With liquidity locked for six years and ownership renounced, SafeMoon Inu addresses common concerns in the crypto space, fostering trust and stability. The project also features a Multi-Sig Community Marketing Wallet, funded collectively by its 16843 token holders for marketing purposes.

It sells at $0.000001746, an 8.40% price increase in 24 hours, with a market cap of $1,745,795 at the time of writing.
2. AstroPepeX (APX)
AstroPepeX (APX) is an innovative Binance and Ethereum blockchain token. It introduces a groundbreaking concept to cryptocurrencies by being entirely AI-generated.

Its creation without human interference ensures APX remains free from biases and manipulation, setting it apart from other tokens.
The project provides utilities to its users and other tokens through its AI-powered token development feature, simplifying and making token creation accessible with AI. The Aiis.dev multichain developer app by AstroPeX enables users to create tokens on seven blockchains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, Base, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche) using ChatGPT AI. The creation process is straightforward and entails only a few steps: users input their ideas and requirements, and the app generates the token code, which is then published on the blockchain for immediate use.

The mission of the APX community is to integrate AI into Ethereum’s development process, offering a comprehensive platform that harnesses the capabilities of AI models for diverse tasks. This dedication to AI-driven solutions and innovation positions AstroPepeX as a compelling and forward-looking investment opportunity in the crypto space, symbolizing a leap into the future of decentralized finance.
Upon launch, token ownership was revoked, and 100% of the tokens, along with 2 ETH, were added to liquidity on Uniswap. AstroPepeX tokens are actively traded on various cryptocurrency platforms, including Poloniex, Bitget, MEXC, and LBank. Poloniex has supported APX by promoting the token on social media platforms.

APX is trading at $0.00006594 and has a market cap of $4,285,678.

The presale attracted 13,607 active participants, who collectively staked over 44,172,876 tokens at an APY exceeding 89%.

With its unique gaming features and meme coin concepts, Meme Kombat occupies an innovative niche.

Finally @BuryCrypto can show us some $MK charts and get us all even more hyped!

The purpose of $MK extends beyond simple buying and trading; it involves staking your tokens in Meme Kombat and participating in battles to win substantial prizes. In addition to regular battles, there will be larger, highly anticipated battles with significant prizes for participants.
Investors still have the opportunity to purchase and stake $MK tokens at a lower rate before any further increases. With the current price sitting at $0.279 and the token recently launched, there is potential for a significant surge, especially considering the substantial holder base amassed during the presale offering. Early adopters of $MK stand to get high ROI before the project starts skyrocketing.

El Salvador is one of the few countries that has legalized Bitcoin by adding a Bitcoin Law to its constitution. 
Following the spring budget speech on February 06, 2024, the United Kingdom unveiled a consultation on its plan to implement the Organization for Economic co-operation and Development (OECD) crypto reporting framework.
As per the claims of the government’s finance arm, the treasury projected in its budget that enforcing the crypto reporting framework could draw in £35 Million between 2026 and 2027 and £95 Million between 2027 and 2028.
The website of the United Kingdom government states that “OECD Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) agreements are a key method by which the UK tackles offshore tax evasion. The Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS2) is the latest AEOI package that ensures we close gaps in existing transparency rules created by developments in fintech.”
These rules are expected to be implemented in 2026. The feedback window over the framework will be available till May 29, 2024. 
The budget further highlights that “The government is also implementing international standards to close gaps in the tax transparency system that have emerged as a result of recent developments in financial technology and the global crypto-asset market.”

Bitcoin’s climb above $65,000 has analysts discussing whether it could hit $70,000 in March, while excitement grows for the upcoming IEO of Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).
Bitcoin Minetrix is a crypto project that aims to make Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone through a unique feature called stake-to-mine. With this, you don’t need costly Bitcoin mining hardware or the electricity to run it anymore.

Bitcoin Minetrix ICO approaches $12 million
Bitcoin has surged past $65,000, marking a significant milestone since December 2021, sparking optimism among many about the future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Crypto enthusiasts attribute this new high to institutional adoption and the upcoming halving, fueling excitement in the community.
Amid the buzz surrounding Bitcoin’s breakthrough, attention has turned to a new crypto project: Bitcoin Minetrix. The platform, offering tokenized cloud mining, is on the verge of raising nearly $12 million in its presale initial coin offering (ICO).
Bitcoin Minetrix isn’t just relying on hype and community growth; it’s also introducing a Stake-to-Mine approach that could revolutionize cloud mining. The aim is to provide everyday crypto enthusiasts with a straightforward way to earn Bitcoin through cloud mining, eliminating risks associated with third-party providers.
By staking $BTCMTX tokens, holders can earn a substantial Annual Percentage Yield (APY), currently offering up to 58% annually. The current token price is $0.0139, set to increase in less than 4 days when the next stage begins.
Participating in the Bitcoin Minetrix presale is straightforward, with various payment options available, including Ethereum, USDT, credit cards, BNB, and MATIC. For a comprehensive guide on purchasing $BTCMTX, please refer to our provided guide here.
Why Bitcoin Minetrix might be your ideal cloud mining solution?
Cloud mining has been around for a while, emerging as traditional mining became dominated by large companies. It involves users renting or purchasing shared computing power and covering the significant energy costs.
While many investors have found success with cloud mining, the space is increasingly attracting scammers. They often require hefty upfront payments and offer complex contracts, making it challenging to determine potential BTC earnings.

Additionally, there are often added fees at the end of contracts, such as for energy consumption and hardware maintenance, which can eat into profits. Bitcoin Minetrix is enhancing security and transparency in cloud mining by allowing users to stake tokens without additional cash payments.
Tokens can be unstaked and sold on an exchange at any time. The lock-in period is chosen by the investor, unlike fixed terms in other cloud mining projects. Coinsult has conducted a comprehensive audit of the smart contract to provide investors with peace of mind.
To delve deeper into the potential value of this project, explore our Bitcoin Minetrix price prediction.
Bitcoin Minetrix tokenomics, roadmap and airdrop
In terms of tokenomics, 42.5% of the BTCMTX token will support Bitcoin Minetrix operations, with 35% designated for marketing, 12.5% for staking, and 10% devoted to the community.
Bitcoin Minetrix has received recognition from major news outlets, such as Cointelegraph, Business Insider, CryptoPotato, and others. The project’s roadmap illustrates key stages, showcasing the team’s commitment to Bitcoin Minetrix’s enduring prosperity.
These stages encompass platform development, facility setup, app and desktop software development, team expansion, negotiations with cloud mining conglomerates, and listings on centralized exchanges. The community’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin Minetrix is evident through various campaigns and airdrops they organize.
To further boost excitement surrounding its progress, the project has introduced a significant airdrop, offering a generous prize pool of $30,000 distributed among ten lucky winners, with each potentially receiving a reward of $3,000.
Participating in the airdrop is straightforward—visit their website, follow their social media accounts, and complete additional tasks to enter the gleam competition. With more than 51,201 entries and 116 days left, this airdrop offers an enticing chance for participants to potentially win significant cash prizes.

Bitcoin has reached a pinnacle, surpassing its previous peak of $69,000 recorded in November 2021 and setting a new all-time high. Deutsche Bank economists attribute this surge to five key factors and forecast a continued increase in Bitcoin’s value throughout the year.
ETF Influx Fuels Bitcoin’s Surge
The cryptocurrency markets have been invigorated, especially with the introduction of new U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have experienced a massive inflow of capital, totaling around $7.9 billion, which has played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s recent price hike and has piqued investor interest in cryptocurrencies.
Expansion of ETF Options
Other digital currencies like Ethereum are also capturing investors’ attention, with the SEC’s upcoming decision on VanEck’s Ethereum ETF application expected by May. Further ETFs, which may include those based on Bitcoin tracking indices, are anticipated from firms like ProShares, signaling a deeper institutional engagement and expansion of the crypto market.
The Anticipated Bitcoin Halving Event
As the fourth Bitcoin halving set for April 2024 nears, focus shifts to historic price trends observed during previous halving occurrences. Price surges of 5%, 13%, and 27% were noted one month prior to the halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, respectively, hinting at possible market movements.
Economic Factors May Favor Crypto Growth
Current economic conditions, such as central banks’ reduced interest rates and volatility in traditional investments, have shifted interest towards cryptocurrencies. Lower treasury yields could drive investors towards alternative assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting liquidity in the crypto market.
Regulatory Clarity Could Bolster Crypto Adoption
While regulatory uncertainty persists, a clearer framework could lead to increased institutional involvement and a reduction in market volatility. Such regulatory developments could encourage broader adoption of cryptocurrencies and contribute to an uptick in their market prices.

Elon Musk Shifts Focus from Crypto to Political and Economic Issues,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 20:04:07.156736,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Elon Musk Shifts Focus from Crypto to Political and Economic Issues
The whimsical magnate Elon Musk, known for his influence on cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins, has recently demonstrated a shift in focus away from the digital asset market. In 2021, Musk’s social media activities precipitated notable price volatilities among various meme coins. His tweets were not only pivotal in catalyzing significant market movements but also spurred the creation of new meme-themed cryptos. Presently, meme coins like Floki and Shiba Inu have garnered substantial interest as a result of Musk’s endorsements.
Elon Musk’s Waning Interest in Cryptos
Despite his history of active engagement and vocal support for cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Musk recently revealed a lessened interest in the digital currency space during a live Space broadcast alongside tech figure Cathie Wood. The entrepreneur admitted that the crypto sphere no longer captivates his attention as it once did, signaling a notable change in his stance.
Musk’s Commentary Triggers PEPE Coin Spike
In a surprising turn, Musk’s recent interaction with a social media post involving a meme coin mascot resulted in a price surge for PEPE Coin, which saw it hitting its highest value of the day. This response mirrors past incidents where Musk’s comments have led to immediate, albeit short-lived, market reactions.
Nowadays, Musk seems to be more engrossed with issues pertaining to U.S. politics and the prevailing economic landscape. Subjects such as policy missteps by the current government and the contentious matter of illegal immigration are drawing his commentary more than the realm of cryptocurrencies. Despite this new focus, Musk’s sporadic inputs on meme coins continue to exert a transient impact on their valuations.
While Musk’s latest commentary ushered in a temporary peak for PEPE Coin, with its price reaching $0.00000786, the surge was ephemeral, with the value subsequently receding to $0.0000072. This pattern underscores the persisting influence Musk’s statements have on cryptocurrency prices, even as his personal investment in the sector appears to be waning.

On Tuesday, Bitcoin surpassed its November 2021 level of $69,000, setting a new all-time high. Economists at Deutsche Bank explained five reasons for Bitcoin‘s record trading levels and its sustained high value. According to economists, Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise this year.
Spot Bitcoin ETF Sees Record Inflows
The cryptocurrency markets have gained momentum, particularly with the entry of new US spot Bitcoin ETFs.
With recent approvals, these ETFs have seen an influx of approximately $7.9 billion. This has triggered the recent price increases of Bitcoin and boosted investor interest in the cryptocurrency world.
More ETFs Likely on the Horizon
Not only Bitcoin, but other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are also on investors’ radars. The SEC‘s decision on VanEck’s Ethereum ETF application is expected by May.

Additionally, companies like ProShares are reported to have plans to launch ETFs based on Bitcoin tracking indices. All these developments contribute to the further institutionalization and growth of the cryptocurrency world.
Bitcoin Halving Approaches
April 2024 marks an important event in the cryptocurrency world: the fourth Bitcoin halving is rapidly approaching. As the date draws near, attention is turning to the typical price movements surrounding previous halving events.
In the 30 days before the November 2012 halving, prices rose by 5%. Before the July 2016 event, there was a larger gain of 13%. Lastly, in the month before the May 2020 halving, there was a significant price increase of 27%.
Economic Shifts Indicate a Smoother Horizon Ahead
Economically, central banks lowering interest rates and uncertainties in traditional asset classes are increasing interest in cryptocurrencies.
Falling treasury yields could lead investors to seek alternative assets, potentially increasing liquidity in the cryptocurrency market.
Regulations Could Provide Positive Contributions
However, uncertainties regarding regulations continue. A clearer regulatory framework could increase institutional participation and reduce market volatility. This could lead to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and an increase in their prices.

"WIF Whales Gorge On SMOG Token Amid Meme Coin Mania, Binance Listing In View After New All-Time Highs",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 20:04:11.758569,"Solana-based meme coin $SMOG’s price powered 60% higher overnight as the Asian buying frenzy continues and rumors of a Binance listing abound.   
The dragon coin with a monster 35% of total supply being airdropped is firing up. Its price keeps breaking new ground as its parabolic run-up continues. $SMOG token is valued at $0.28 and could soon be trading at $1 if the present rate of appreciation continues.   
Meme coins are outperforming all other altcoin sectors, and beating bitcoin too, as investors search out tenbagger returns. Rare in the world of stocks, 10x gains are far from a rarity in the meme coin space, as $SMOG’s performance shows.  
Over the past 24 hours $SMOG was the top gainer overall. It was the third-placed overall gainer among the top 500 coins over a seven-day period and is a top trending coin on various trading sites – it reached No.3 on Dextools for instance. 

It has now become a habit of see ATH everyday… #SMOGSOAR$SMOG#ATH pic.twitter.com/jdDvFDmNls— Minesh Gurung (@gurung_minesh) March 7, 2024

And if exchange listing rumors are to be believed, that ‘kill the zero’ moment could come much sooner.  


  


 Dogwifhat and $MYRO tokens recently listed on Binance, helping to propel both of them to an all-time high price. Now it looks like the same could be in store for $SMOG.


  
   
If it is not Binance then it could be another top tier exchange like OKX or KuCoin for example.  
Either way, as the famed trading aphorism would have it, “the trend is your friend”, so don’t fight it at this point – see the 1-hour candles on the $SMOG price chart below:  

  
WIF Whales Queue Up To Buy $SMOG  
Interestingly it appears that Dogwifhat whales are leading the charge that’s pushing the $SMOG price higher.   
In a cheeky move to encourage more WIF whales to join the gold rush, the $SMOG team has set up a Swap WIF for SMOG quest on Zealy. Meanwhile, to get the party started, $SMOG is being airdropped to every WIF wallet.   
According to the quest page, XP will be allocated based on the dollar value of the $WIF swaps to $SMOG made. In essence then, the more you swap the bigger the XP earnings, which will of course appeal to deep-pocketed WIF whales.  
Here are the full instructions to earn the XP airdrop points:   

Swap $WIF to $SMOG from Birdeye, Jupiter or another DEX  
Before the end of Phase 1 of Airdrop, XP will be allocated based on amount of $WIF swapped to $SMOG  
To complete, users must swap $WIF to $SMOG from a DEX  
Users must submit a screenshot with the completed transaction  
Once completed, users will earn XP allocated based on amount owned 
  
Any whales, or others, with queries can reach out to the team on Telegram or Discord.  
Mind you, it is not just the WIF crowd that is hoovering up $SMOG. Here is a table of buys valued at over $10k coming in from SOL holders:  

  
$SMOG Market Cap Blasts Past $200 million, But There’s Billions More Up For Grabs  
$SMOG has hit a market cap valuation of $213 million, amassed a staggering 54k token holders in no time, and is now commanding a 24-hour trading volume of almost $7 million. The fully diluted market cap has swollen to $392 million.  
Still, those achievements notwithstanding, there are probably billions of dollars sitting on the table for investors in the know that have stumbled upon this gem. A 5x price surge to take the token past $1 billion market cap might be just the beginning for this new Shiba Inu. $SHIB has a market cap of $19 billion.  
The loveable dragon token has caught the eye of Asian buyers in this year of the dragon, but market participants in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions as well as the Americas are not going to be left behind as money floods in from all directions.  
What’s more, after achieving a new all-time high above $69,000, bitcoin may have entered a period of consolidation, providing investors with an opening to seek out alpha in altcoins, and in particular among the meme coins.  
$SMOG’s rally has produced a 22,543% gain for early buyers, since it launched on February 7, according to DEX Screener data.  

  
$SMOG can currently be bought through decentralized exchanges such as Jupiter. SOL tokens have been flowing out of centralized exchanges into non-custodial wallets as investors look to enter trades in fair launch tokens such as $SMOG, which for now can only be bought on DEXs.  
New meme coins running on Ethereum are also getting attention. However, some buyers are deterred by the high fees, which at busy times are north of $200 as Ethereum rockets in price. $ETH is currently valued at $3,814 – within spitting distance of $4k, while $SOL is outperforming it, up 7% at $139.95.  
For sure the hot money is finding a home on the Solana network and SMOG is one of the main beneficiaries.  
Perhaps even more significant for the longevity of the $SMOG bull run is the way, over the past 48 hours or so, it is outrunning older meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, down 7 and 10% respectively at the start of the US session.   

  
How To Buy Smog Token, Join the SMOG Airdrop Campaign  
To take part in the SMOG airdrop prospective participants will need to avail themselves of a Solana-compatible – Phantom is a popular pick.  
Buyers can then head over to Jupiter DEX or Birdeye to buy $SMOG, using SOL, USDT, or BONK. Investors can also buy directly on the Smog website, where you can buy and stake on the Ethereum chain to claim a 10% discount and earn 42% APY.  
The full airdrop campaign offering of quests is available on the Zealy platform, where the completion of tasks such as signing up for socials and trading the token will enable holders to boost their airdrop allocation.   
The community can also win $5,000 worth of $SMOG in the weekly giveaway competition that ends every Friday at 5pm UTC. So there really is all to play for with $SMOG.  
Participants can also boost their chance of being selected for the Loyal Chosen as part of the gamification aspect of the campaign, where mystery is the order of the day and bonuses and rewards lurk in the dragon’s lair, waiting to be captured.  
YouTube crypto tipster Jacob Crypto Bury rates $SMOG as one of his top eight meme coins to buy now.
    
Sign up to the Smog community on X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram to keep abreast of project developments. As the altcoin season kicks into gear, it is meme coins that are leading the pack and Solana-based variants in particular.   
The marketing lingo talks about ‘one meme coin to rule them all’ and that might be exactly what new holders could be buying into, as $SMOG fulfils its mission to be the next Shiba Inu, Pepe or Bonk.

BTC price needs 5% dip to liquidate $2B of Bitcoin longs,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 20:04:12.856254,"Bitcoin (BTC) will liquidate $2 billion of BTC long positions if it drops just $3,000 from current levels.
Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass shows traders making huge bets on BTC price trajectory.
Bitcoin trader: “Welcome to volatility city”
After plummeting $10,000 in hours following new all-time highs on March 5, Bitcoin has rebounded, making for a interesting situation on exchanges.

Traders are betting big on both sides of the current spot price, which is headed toward $67,400 at the time of writing after the March 7 Wall Street open, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.
CoinGlass underscores just how much is at stake: It would only take a dip to $64,286, for example, to liquidate $2 billion of long BTC positions.
$60,000 would see $2.33 billion of longs get the chop, with this still higher than the bounce zone of the $10,000 red daily candle.
To the upside, breaking the latest all-time highs of $69,210 would liquidate around $1.31 billion of BTC shorts, with the tally hitting $1.57 billion at $70,000.

As a reminder of market capability, BTC/USD saw a $1,000 move up and down in a matter of minutes after the latest Wall Street open.
“Doing $1K candles in 1 minute now,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades reacted on X. 

 “Welcome to volatility city.”

New 30% BTC price correction warning
As Cointelegraph reported, the all-time high area represents a significant psychological barrier for current Bitcoin market participants.

Beyond this, price discovery awaits, while some hodlers have waited years simply to break even on coins purchased at the previous highs in November 2021.
Analysts’ opinions on how high BTC/USD could go remain highly varied, with six-figure targets mixing with calls for an imminent top.
Among the latter camp is Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading.
“What’s next? We’ll sweep to $70K and take liquidity as a scenario,” he wrote in part of a recent X update.
Later, Van de Poppe doubled down on the idea that Bitcoin has little room left to run before April’s block subsidy halving event.
The correction, when it comes, he argued, could be 30%.

Nigeria’s SEC proposes guidelines for crypto firms to fight criminals,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 20:04:13.938654,"The Nigerian securities regulatory authority has introduced new guidelines for crypto service providers.
According to local reports, Nigeria’s SEC is moving to block criminals from interacting with the capital markets. New SEC guidance will ensure that criminals are not registered as operators in the capital markets, although it is unclear how criminality will be investigated.
The guidance, which includes anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations, aims to prevent criminals from accessing the country’s capital market.

“The SEC has also developed a new AML/CFT/CPF onboarding manual for licensing/registration and ongoing screening of Digital and VASP Beneficial Owners to ensure that criminals are not registered as operators in the capital market.” SEC statement

The restrictions come amid an ongoing investigation by Nigerian authorities into Binance, which is accused of illegal activities in the country and manipulation of the naira exchange rate.
Users in Nigeria began reporting about this the day before. Representatives of the largest crypto exchange sent emails to Nigerian users. They noted that they know the current situation and actively interact with Nigerian regulatory authorities.

Stablecoin Standard, the industry body for stablecoin issuers globally, and Aleph Zero, a privacy-enhancing layer 1 blockchain announce their strategic partnership aimed at stimulating commerce on chain.
By partnering with Stablecoin Standard, Aleph Zero is engaging with most of the top stablecoin issuers around the world, currently representing 17 differently denominated currencies, including CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY and USD. The objective is to enable users of the Aleph Zero ecosystem to have multiple safe harbors on-chain that they can settle in, no matter where they are based. As Stablecoin Standard aggregates more fiat-backed stablecoin issuers, Aleph Zero users will have greater access to on-ramp and settlement options denominated in their domestic currencies.
Stablecoin Standard and Aleph Zero recognize that true privacy is not about hiding all information, but rather, empowering people to choose selectively what they share. Privacy means giving individuals control over their personal information, just as they have in traditional finance and the real world.
Consumers expect their transactions to be private by default, so the adoption of stablecoins on privacy-focused blockchains is set to shape the future of web3 commerce. However, Aleph Zero’s privacy also actively addresses anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements. By combining price-stable cryptocurrencies with inherent on-chain anonymity, these networks allow for private, legally-compliant, and censorship-resistant transactions ideal for e-commerce and payments. 

 “Historically, we talk about fast speeds, low costs and transparency when showcasing the benefits of the next generation of blockchains. However, if we expect private businesses to conduct business on-chain, there will need to be a higher degree of confidentiality to protect sensitive information. Aleph Zero is solving this problem and will unlock the true potential of commerce on chain” states Christian Walker, Chairman & Co-Founder of Stablecoin Standard. 

Aside from reconciling in local currencies for businesses on-chain, other exciting use cases that will be explored include on-chain FX and instantaneous international remittance.

 Matthew Niemerg, co-founder of Aleph Zero, said: ""As one of the fastest layer 1 blockchains, we envision many real-world use cases for Aleph Zero. Our partnership with Stablecoin Standard opens up multiple possibilities and will provide vital services for users who want to transact with stablecoins. With inherent compliant-privacy features like shielded transactions and assets, Aleph Zero can offer the anonymity expected from traditional payments – setting the stage to bring commerce on-chain. By combining speed, safe havens, and transaction privacy, we aim to provide ideal infrastructure for the next generation of web3 adoption.”

Bitcoin and Gold Hit Record Highs: Insights from Gareth Soloway,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 20:04:20.377123,"
In a special episode of “On the Spot” filmed in Tampa, Florida, Michelle McCory had the opportunity to sit down with Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at Verified Investing. The timing couldn’t have been more fortuitous, as both Bitcoin and gold reached new all-time highs on the same day. Soloway shared his insights on this unique market scenario and the potential implications for investors.
A Tale of Two Assets: Gold and Bitcoin
Traditionally, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, a refuge in times of market uncertainty. In contrast, Bitcoin, despite efforts by enthusiasts to brand it as a store of value, is widely regarded as a high-risk, volatile investment. The simultaneous surge in prices of these two assets, according to Soloway, reflects a peculiar market environment.
The recent rally in Bitcoin can be attributed to a risk-on market sentiment, with investors gravitating towards high-risk assets. This trend has been evident in the stock market, particularly in the tech sector, with companies like Nvidia and the overall NASDAQ index reaching new heights. The excitement surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has also fueled investor enthusiasm, reminiscent of the speculative frenzy seen in assets like GameStop and AMC.
On the other hand, gold’s resilience and its recent push to new highs can be linked to sustained buying by central banks. Despite the risk-on environment, gold has not retreated significantly from its peak, which Soloway interprets as a sign of smart money hedging against a potential bubble in risk assets.





The Interplay of Market Forces
Soloway warns that Bitcoin could face significant downside if the stock market experiences a sharp sell-off. He highlights the correlation between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ, noting that a downturn in the stock market could lead to a substantial correction in Bitcoin prices.
Furthermore, Soloway discusses the impact of leverage in the cryptocurrency market, which can exacerbate price fluctuations. He contrasts this with the traditional stock market, where leverage is more constrained.
Looking ahead, Soloway remains cautious about Bitcoin’s prospects in the event of a broader market correction. He suggests that if the risk-off sentiment takes hold, Bitcoin could retrace to levels around $30,000 to $32,000.
Gold’s Brightening Prospects
In the realm of gold, Soloway sees a brighter future. He believes that smart money is increasingly rotating into gold as a hedge against potential bubbles in risk assets. The recent breakout in gold prices, driven by momentum, is a testament to this shift.
As for gold miners, Soloway points out that they have faced challenges due to rising costs. However, if gold prices continue to outpace inflation, their profitability could improve significantly, leading to outperformance in the sector.
A Look Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty
In the broader market, Soloway anticipates challenges ahead, particularly with government spending and inflationary pressures. He expresses concern over the sustainability of current fiscal policies and the potential implications for the economy and financial markets.
Despite the near-term allure of Bitcoin, Soloway advises caution, noting that signs of speculative excess often precede market corrections. He underscores the importance of being prepared for a range of outcomes, including geopolitical tensions and unexpected events.
Our Take on It
Gareth Soloway’s insights shed light on the complex dynamics driving the current market landscape. We’d like to add a few more points this Analysis, in regards to Bitcoin cycles.
The behavior of Bitcoin after reaching new highs is crucial in understanding market dynamics. Historically, after breaching all-time highs, the market tends to heat up quickly. If this trend continues, it could lead to a peak in Q4 of 2025, aligning with previous cycles. However, the current cycle’s unique characteristics, combined with the influence of monetary policy, add layers of complexity to this prediction.
The correlation between Bitcoin’s performance and other economic indicators, such as gold prices and the labor market, further complicates the Analysis. For instance, gold’s breakout in 2019 coincided with a peak in Bitcoin, suggesting a potential cooling-off period for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the labor market’s strength, particularly the unemployment rate, could play a significant role in Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

"Next Cryptocurrency To Explode Thursday, March 7 – Render, Sei, Fantom",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 20:04:22.345374,"Every day, the crypto market emerges with a unique narrative. The crypto bull market recently encountered a pushback after the BTC price surpassed its ATH value. However, the current trends across the board make it apparent that altcoins are the next cryptocurrencies to explode as investors’ interest has turned in that direction.
There’s been a significant surge in the price of many altcoins, with AI and DePINs leading the way. Owing to the rising value of these cryptos, several traders believe there is a high chance that they’ll also follow the BTC trend, surpassing their ATH values before the end of the quarter.
Next Cryptocurrency To Explode 
As the altcoin season kicks off, it’s essential to note that assets in the AI sectors appear to earn more inflow. Many tokens like RNDR, FET, and AGIX have recorded double-digit price increases in the last 24 hours. Similarly, upcoming projects like Scotty the AI are increasingly gaining visibility. Today’s update provides a quick overview of the project and how to participate in the presale.
1. Fantom (FTM)
Fantom posted a 52-week high today after a 20% increase in price. Even though the trading volume of FTM today is considerably lower than the value recorded at the same time yesterday, the overall price action in the crypto market reflects on its price. Moreover, the progressively increasing price can be traced to the recent activity across its network.
FTM had increased social media exposure through its Fanthom Sonic mainnet launch. The upgrade comes with an improved Fantom Virtual Machine, which is said to be faster and executes better. Other activities, like the platform’s role at ETHDenver 2024, also gave it exposure that reflected its current trend.

With a price of $0.81 at the time of writing, FTM is only 10% away from breaking above its $0.91 resistance. If the token climbs above the price, it will likely witness a dramatic rally toward the $1.1 range. Ultimately, FTM’s chance of breaking its ATH at its current pace is relatively high.

Since the July 2023 Multichain exploit, Fantom Foundation’s management and legal team have been working tirelessly across multiple jurisdictions to chart a path forward that enables victims to partially recover assets lost. We have an important update in this regard.
After all… pic.twitter.com/pUxyalPdMD
— Fantom Foundation (@FantomFDN) March 4, 2024


Furthermore, one of the catalogs that might fuel the next phase of FTM’s price pump is the platform’s decision to work towards reducing the loss incurred from the 2023 exploit. In July of 2023, the Fantom network suffered significantly from the exploit on the Multichain bridge.
Fantom Foundation sought redress, which the Multichain Foundation refused to do, and they decided to take legal action against Multichain. The court gave the default victor to Fantom Foundation in the case as Multichain declined to respond, possibly leading to Fantom Foundation liquidating Multichain’s assets. According to the post on its blog, the proceeds will likely be used to compensate users who incurred losses from the exploit.
2. Scotty the AI (SCOTTY) 
In a decentralized economy, the probability of crime is relatively high. This situation is more evident in the crypto market, where many projects that go live are littered with fraudulent practices.

Thus, the community behind the Scotty the AI project envisions a safer cyberspace where anyone can trade cryptocurrency without the fear of scams. This narrative is embodied in the project’s mascot, Scotty. The idea is to build an AI watchdog that tracks and identifies flaws in projects or transactions.
The project is still in the works, and investors who are looking to invest in the artificial intelligence sector still have the opportunity to join the movement. The token has a presale price of  $0.0078, and over $3.3 million have been invested in the project.

The SCOTTY team and community have more milestones before the token is listed on exchanges. Upon listing, there is a high chance that SCOTTY would record a significant pump in price due to the growing interest in the AI sector. Ultimately, investors can find additional images about the project on its presale page.

3. Render (RNDR)
Today, despite the recent pullback recorded in the market, RNDR pushed above the $10 mark, establishing a new ATH value. The sudden rise in value comes from its growing influence in the AI sector.
A recent example is its partnership with the emerging GPU project IONET, which aims to assemble over 10000 GPUs through decentralized tech. Generally, The advancement of Render in the artificial intelligence space has positioned it as a project to watch in the DePIN sector.

While its native token, RNDR, may appear to have achieved a significant increase in value, there’s more room for an increase. As the demand for GPU services increases, the services of platforms like Render will increase dramatically.

— io.net (@ionet_official) March 7, 2024


From the technical analysis, most of the bullish indicators applied to its market data return bullish signals. Its MACD reasons show that the market is still very bullish on the RNDR token. Consequently, it might continue its ride above the $10 range.
In addition, the token in the last 24 hours recorded an increase of over 20% and a trading volume pump of over 180%. This trend reveals that the market is responding positively to its recent performance, which might be the fuel it needs to continue its upward ride. Ultimately, RNDR is one of the tokens to watch this season as the bullish trend funds flow into the Altcoins market.
4. Sei (SEI)
Despite being a highly volatile asset, SEI is on track to becoming one of the next cryptocurrencies to explode. In the last 24 hours, it has recorded over 12% price increase. The token’s price might cross the $1 mark before the end of the quarter. The increasing activities in the network and the growing use cases would likely be the catalyst to trigger the price action.

Furthermore, the SEI community should look forward to increasing activities as the platform moves into NFTs. The initiative comes after its partnership with the Akita Inu Preservation Society. The partnership opens more doors to the project in Japan. With that, SEI would like more use cases in the metaverse, art, culture, and other blockchains. Thus, the growing demand for the token will likely influence its future performance.

The Sei community is thrilled to work alongside @MetaAkita, a leading initiative from the renowned Akita Inu Preservation Society 🐕
Sei is continuing to build culturally significant relationships in Japan and with this Seiyans can anticipate adorable NFTs and a dedicated Akita… pic.twitter.com/vN1UMj6AgG
— Sei 🔴💨 (@SeiNetwork) March 5, 2024


Even though SEI declined consistently from mid-last month until recently, it found support at $0.7. Hence, the likelihood of rallying to a new ATH value is relatively high. Moreover, the SEI RSI reading is closer to the oversold side. The value signals that the bulls might soon have the upper hand.
Similarly, other indicators applied to the SEI chart reveal further bullish signals. Readings from its Bull Bear Power indicator also returned a -0.0158, which is also bullish. On the other hand, short-term moving averages applied to the chart show that SEI may be bearish in the short term but bullish in the long run. Hence, it is essential to take precautions and research the asset further to identify the best strategies to apply.

Pantera to Broker Big Solana (SOL) Buyout from FTX,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 20:04:23.502871,"Pantera Capital, a premier asset manager with assets totaling $5.2 billion, is currently in the process of raising funds from institutional investors to acquire deeply discounted Solana (SOL) tokens from the estate of bankrupt digital asset exchange FTX.
In 2022, due to a market price crash, Pantera Capital’s early-stage token fund incurred a loss of more than fifty percent of its value that year. It is however hoping to do things differently with Solana.
The Pantera Solana Fund Objectives and Strategy
The investment opportunity, known as the Pantera Solana Fund, aims to raise capital to purchase up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens from the FTX estate at a discounted rate.
As observed by Bloomberg, participants in the Pantera Solana Fund have the option of purchasing SOL tokens either at a discount of 39% below the 30-day average price or at a fixed rate of $59.95. Nevertheless, investors are required to adhere to a vesting period of up to four years to access this purchasing opportunity.
Pantera Capital, leading the initiative, has advanced a strategic plan aimed at assisting FTX liquidators under John J. Ray III in offloading SOL holdings from the estate. The purpose is to deflect market pressure on the token’s value. Currently, the FTX estate possesses around 41.1 million SOL coins, valued at $5.4 billion.
Implications and Future Outlook for Solana
In the past year, Solana (SOL) has witnessed an impressive surge of almost 650% amidst the prevailing cryptocurrency bull market. This surge provides an opening for the FTX estate to generate funds for creditor repayment, given that SOL’s value, though currently stagnant, has nearly quadrupled since FTX’s downfall in November 2022.
Pantera Capital set a goal to conclude the fund by February’s end, as outlined in the investor presentation. Although exact fundraising numbers remain undisclosed, a knowledgeable source affirmed that Pantera Capital managed to secure some funding by the stipulated deadline. The source, preferring anonymity when discussing sensitive details, opted not to reveal the precise amount raised.
Pantera Capital Demands $25 Million from Investors
According to the marketing materials, Pantera Capital mandates that investors in the Pantera Solana Fund commit a minimum of $25 million each. In exchange, SOL tokens will undergo an initial lock-up period, gradually vesting over four years. Pantera Capital intends to levy a management fee of 0.75% and a performance fee of 10%.
FTX and its affiliate Alameda Research have not only amassed a considerable stake in SOL but have also committed substantial funding to startups operating within Solana’s extensive ecosystem. Particularly noteworthy is the collaboration between FTX’s venture arm, Solana Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which jointly revealed a $100 million blockchain gaming fund in November 2021.

Bitcoin (BTC) & Uniswap (UNI) Make Waves with Kelexo (KLXO) Presale Stage 2: Stellar (XLM) & Litecoin (LTC) Eye Up 30X Predictions,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 20:04:24.646403,"The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a flurry of activity as Bitcoin (BTC), Uniswap (UNI), Stellar (XLM) and Litecoin (LTC) all make significant moves, each with its unique set of developments and price surges. 
Amidst these market movements, Kelexo (KLXO) continues to captivate investors’ attention with its presale stage 2, offering an enticing opportunity to participate in its transformative banking platform at a price of $0.04 per token as investors eye up 30X predictions.
Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Volatility: Liquidations and Open Interest Decline
Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a turbulent week as its price fluctuated between $60,990 and $66,900, witnessing a notable increase of 10.29%. Despite briefly touching $69.3k, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a retracement, dropping to $61k later in the day. This roller-coaster trajectory triggered the liquidation of $310 million in Bitcoin (BTC) futures positions within the last 24 hours.
Additionally, Bitcoin (BTC) climb to an all-time high (ATH) resulted in a significant decline in Open Interest (OI) for Bitcoin (BTC), with approximately $1.46 billion in OI wiped out following the peak, representing a 12% drop.
Uniswap (UNI) Governance Proposal Leads to Price Surge
The Uniswap (UNI) community recently made a historic decision regarding governance, unanimously approving a proposal to reward Uniswap (UNI) token holders for staking and delegating their tokens. 
This significant shift in Uniswap (UNI) governance structure allows for the automatic collection of protocol fees, which will then be distributed proportionally to active Uniswap (UNI) holders who have staked and delegated their votes. The proposal aims to incentivize participation and engagement within the Uniswap (UNI) community.
Stellar (XLM) Price Surge Indicates Bullish Momentum
Stellar (XLM) has experienced a notable surge in its weekly price, ranging between $0.11 and $0.14, with an impressive increase of 13.40%. This surge comes as the Stellar coin (XLM) successfully broke out of its previous price range and surpassed key EMA barriers, resulting in a sharp uptick in value. 
Additionally, indicators such as technical analysis signals and bullish crossovers suggest a favorable market sentiment, further fueling investor confidence in Stellar (XLM). At the time of reporting, the price of Stellar (XLM) stood at $0.1349, highlighting bullish accumulation patterns on the Stellar (XLM) charts. 
Litecoin (LTC) Sees Buying Activity Amidst Resistance
Litecoin (LTC) has experienced a notable surge in its monthly price, ranging between $67.7 and $84.5, marking an increase of 23.60%. Analyzing the Litecoin (LTC) daily price chart reveals ongoing buying activity in Litecoin (LTC) as it strives to meet buyers’ demand and push toward the high of $92. 
Despite attempts to surge above this level over the last 24 hours, Litecoin (LTC) faces resistance from bears, hindering further upward movement. The increased Litecoin (LTC) trading volume of $37 million in the past 24 hours indicates a heightened interest in trading activity, contributing to Litecoin (LTC) price surge.
Kelexo (KLXO) Keeps Making Waves
Securing a loan through conventional channels often involves navigating a labyrinth of challenges, from hefty fees to bureaucratic hurdles and stringent compliance requirements. However, Kelexo (KLXO) is poised to revolutionize the banking process by streamlining identification and compliance procedures, making financial markets more accessible to a wider range of individuals. 
With the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market expected to grow from $143.54 billion in 2023 to $190.22 billion in 2024, Kelexo (KLXO) is at the forefront of this burgeoning industry, presenting an enticing opportunity for investors to participate early in the Kelexo (KLXO) presale stage at a price of $0.04 per Kelexo (KLXO) token.

"Altcoin Symphony: Kelexo (KLXO) Under-Valued Presale Hits $0.04, Polygon (MATIC) & Tether (USDT) Predict 20X Surge Within Lending Sensation",COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 20:04:25.699401,"In the ever-evolving market of cryptocurrencies, a symphony of altcoins is playing out, with Kelexo (KLXO), Polygon (MATIC) and Tether (USDT) taking center stage. Kelexo (KLXO) emerges as an under-valued gem in the presale arena, hitting a promising price point of $0.04. 
Meanwhile, Polygon (MATIC) and Tether (USDT) are poised for significant movements, with analysts predicting a potential 20X surge within the lending sensation. As investors navigate this intricate ensemble of digital assets, the spotlight shines on Kelexo (KLXO) and its transformative potential within the burgeoning blockchain lending sector.
Polygon (MATIC) Faces Potential Retrace Amidst Analyst Predictions
Polygon (MATIC) has seen a notable increase in its weekly price, reaching between $0.98 and $1.09, marking a rise of 10.97%. However analysts are cautious about Polygon (MATIC) upward momentum anticipating a market correction in the near future. Despite recent gains, Polygon (MATIC) may soon experience a retrace, as experts foresee potential downward pressure on Polygon (MATIC) price.
With Polygon (MATIC) recording a substantial 22% increase in trade volume, analysts are closely monitoring its movements, awaiting signs of a market correction. If this correction materializes, Polygon (MATIC) could potentially dip below its recent milestone of $1. Investors are advised to remain vigilant as the trend of Polygon (MATIC) unfolds in the coming days, with a downward spiral looming if market indicators continue to signal a correction.
Tether (USDT): Stability Amidst Crypto Market Volatility
Tether (USDT) has maintained a stable weekly price, fluctuating between $1.0000 and $1.0015, with a modest increase of 0.17%. What sets Tether (USDT) apart is its unique feature of being pegged to the U.S. dollar, backed by equivalent reserves held by Tether (USDT). Every issuance of new Tether (USDT) tokens is accompanied by an allocation of the same amount in USD to ensure that the cryptocurrency remains fully supported by cash and cash equivalents.
The inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, where values can swing dramatically in a single day, makes reliable stores of value a challenge. Tether (USDT), protected from such fluctuations, emerges as a safe haven for crypto investors. During periods of market turbulence, investors can shift their portfolios to Tether (USDT) without completely cashing out into USD. 
Kelexo (KLXO) Under-Valued Presale Hits $0.04
Securing loans through traditional channels often involves navigating a maze of challenges, from hefty fees to bureaucratic hurdles and stringent compliance requirements. However, Kelexo (KLXO) is poised to revolutionize the banking process by streamlining identification and compliance procedures, making financial markets more accessible to a wider range of individuals. 
As one of the first online lending platforms built on the blockchain, Kelexo (KLXO) offers enhanced security, transparency and decentralized governance.

Trump’s Crypto Holdings Surge to $6.26M+; Interest Peaks in Solana & Emerging AI Altcoin,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 20:04:26.724255,"Former President Donald Trump recently ventured into digital investment.

His crypto investment ranged from upcoming memecoins like Maga (MAGA) to top DeFi projects like Polygon (MATIC).
Now that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing healthy growth, attention has shifted to altcoins with the potential to deliver bullish breakouts soon. Among the top performers are InQubeta (QUBE) and Solana (SOL). While Solana has been pulling impressive interest with its recent surge, InQubeta has been delivering mouth watering growth during its presale. These performances have increased investment interest in both altcoins.
Let’s explore the rising interest in Solana and InQubeta as Trump’s crypto holdings increase.
InQubeta (QUBE) Commands Impressive Interest In Its Early Development Stage 
InQubeta recently progressed into the eighth stage of its ongoing presale, and the excitement surrounding the platform continues to hit new highs. Investors can buy the QUBE token at a discount price of $0.0245. The token is set to rally to $0.0308 when it launches on exchanges, offering investors a quick 20% gain. Thanks to rising demand for the crypto ICO, experts are confident that QUBE could rally by a hundredfold. 
InQubeta offers life-changing returns and has more enticing advantages, like profits from the AI sector. InQubeta is an AI-centered cryptocurrency platform praised for using fractionalized NFTs to provide investment opportunities in the AI sector. When QUBE holders buy these NFTs, they reap exponential gains as AI adoption grows. 
InQubeta also introduces staking benefits to the platform, allowing investors to earn passive income. The platform’s commitment to a DeFi approach has won over more investors than expected. The crypto ICO recently hit a milestone sale of over 856 million tokens, raising over $10.9 million. This milestone shows that investor interest has reached new heights, giving the platform a competitive edge over top DeFi projects.

Solana (SOL) Shows Rising Interest, Suggesting Incoming Bullish Run 
Solana recently outperformed Binance (BNB), surpassing it in the cryptocurrency market cap rankings. This success comes from rising interest in the Solana ecosystem, thanks to its affiliations with trending airdrops and meme coins. According to on-chain activity, Solana’s Open Interest recently grew by over 110%, hitting a new record of around $1.75 billion. This development proves that investor engagement and market activity are increasing for SOL.
The excitement from Bitcoin’s climb to $68,000 has also boosted interest in Solana. The Bitcoin halving event is less than two months away, and since it’s known to trigger bullish moves in altcoins, investors have been filing into Solana. Some analysts have predicted that SOL will be worth $500 by the end of the year.
Trump Records Impressive Profits From Crypto Investing 
Donald Trump has increased his crypto asset holdings to $6.26 million, thanks to a well-timed investment in Trump-branded tokens. Trump, who has been neutral towards Bitcoin, finds his crypto portfolio boosted by the TRUMP token. The token represents over $2.98 million in his holdings. His investment strategy isn’t fixed on this one token; there’s also 340 Ethereum (ETH) and over 368 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).
Both of them are worth nearly $2 million. Trump’s collection of NFT cards increases his cryptocurrency net worth to $6.26 million. The TRUMP token has delivered an impressive 44% appreciation to $5.19, showcasing its growing popularity. Despite this, Trump’s direct influence on Bitcoin’s value is still minor since the TRUMP coin operates within its ecosystem.
Final Thoughts 
Trump’s expanding interest in digital currencies could indirectly affect crypto performance. The more public figures invest in crypto, the more digital investment will grow. InQubeta and Solana are already showing explosive potential, boosting their investment interest. While Solana could hit a new ATH soon, InQubeta could turn new investors into millionaires after its launch. The presale is the best time to invest, and its 15% presale bonus will make it easier for investors to buy as many QUBE tokens as they want.

Bonk Vs O2T – Here’s why The A.I 500x Cryptocurrency has The Game In a Chokehold,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-07 19:04:28.840923,"The post Bonk Vs O2T – Here’s why The A.I 500x Cryptocurrency has The Game In a Chokehold appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Option2Trade (O2T) has disrupted the cryptocurrency market with its innovative AI technology and 500x returns. It challenges established players like Bonk (BONK) and captures investors’ imagination. Option2Trade (O2T) is not just participating in the game, but rewriting the rules and holding the game in a chokehold. This deep dive explores the unique technological advantages, investor sentiment, and market trends that underpin Option2Trade’s (O2T) rise and disruptive impact.
A Technological Leap Forward: O2T’s A.I Mastery
At the heart of Option2Trade’s (O2T) allure is its sophisticated A.I technology, a cornerstone feature that distinguishes it sharply from Bonk (BONK) and other traditional or meme tokens. Option2Trade (O2T) leverages risk management solutions, technical analysis tools, and AI-driven algorithms to offer an unparalleled trading experience. Its highly acclaimed algo trading bot, which has been fine-tuned over more than two years, has delivered consistent profits to over 450 traders worldwide. This technological prowess not only enhances trading efficiency but also democratizes access to high-level financial strategies, previously the domain of professional traders.
Disrupting the Status Quo: O2T vs. Bonk (BONK)
While Bonk (BONK) enjoys popularity as a meme token, riding waves of social media hype and community endorsement, Option2Trade (O2T) carves out a niche that transcends the ephemeral nature of meme-driven investments. Option2Trade’s (O2T) commitment to leveraging A.I for Financial Empowerment offers a solid value proposition that appeals to a broader spectrum of investors, from novices to seasoned professionals. This strategic divergence from the meme token playbook positions Option2Trade (O2T) as a token with substantial utility and long-term growth potential.
Investor Sentiment: Betting on Innovation
The promise of 500x returns is not just a catchy headline; it reflects a broader investor sentiment favoring innovation and technological advancement in the cryptocurrency space. Option2Trade (O2T) taps into this sentiment by offering a tangible pathway to significant gains through its A.I-driven platform. The enthusiasm for Option2Trade’s (O2T) potential disrupts traditional investment patterns, drawing capital and interest away from meme tokens like Bonk (BONK) and towards more technologically sophisticated ventures. This shift underscores a maturing cryptocurrency market that values utility, sustainability, and the potential for exponential growth.





Market Trends: The Rise of A.I Finance
The ascension of Option2Trade (O2T) is emblematic of a larger market trend towards A.I finance, a sector poised for explosive growth. As investors increasingly seek out platforms that offer advanced analytics, automated trading, and intelligent risk management, Option2Trade (O2T) stands at the forefront of this movement. Its comprehensive suite of features, including social trading, governance, copy trading incentives, staking, trading signals, and liquidity pools, encapsulates the future of cryptocurrency trading. In contrast, the appeal of meme tokens like Bonk (BONK), while still significant, begins to wane in the face of such multifaceted utility.
The Future in O2T’s Grip
As Option2Trade (O2T) continues to make strides in the cryptocurrency market, its blend of A.I technology and the potential for unparalleled returns positions it as a dominant force. In contrast, Bonk (BONK) and similar tokens must navigate an evolving landscape where technological innovation and investor value increasingly dictate success. Option2Trade’s (O2T) ability to hold the game in a chokehold is not just a testament to its current achievements but also a forewarning of the disruptive impact it is set to have on the cryptocurrency space. As the market evolves, the strategic advantages and technological superiority of Option2Trade (O2T) illuminate a path towards redefining what investors expect from their digital assets, marking a new chapter in the annals of cryptocurrency.

  Cover image via U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.
Bitcoin (BTC) rally far from over, say Glassnode cofounders
After revisiting its all-time high of $69,000, Bitcoin succumbed to its mercurious nature and dropped to lows of $62,000. However, the king crypto has managed to recover from the fall and bounced back to the $67,000 price mark, to the great relief of many BTC investors. According to a recent X post by Glassnode cofounders (@Negentropic_), this recent drop in the Bitcoin price was not a random event, but an ABC-correction, which ""retested the former consolidation triangle."" In their opinion, the retest and the significance of the $59,000-62,000 range indicate that the market may be about to embark on a V-shaped recovery that will take it to new highs. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,037, per CoinMarketCap.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) expecting something big, teased update excites community
Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama has recently been very vocal about the updates his project's ecosystem is potentially facing. One of them is a projection that Shiba Inu's valuation could reach $100 billion in the long term, which followed after SHIB's market cap surpassed $13 billion. The surge in market value helped SHIB enter the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies, pushing Avalanche down to 11th place. Additionally, earlier this week, Kusama announced the launch of Shib Name Service (SNS) in partnership with D3. Another most recent update from the SHIB lead dated March 6 is his X post, in which he stated that he has been in meetings, ""talking to the other side of the world,"" discussing the upcoming announcement and release of an important SHIB-themed service/product. It seems that with this multitude of announcements, Kusama is aiming to complement the SHIB token's price rally.
Charles Hoskinson will not leave Cardano and IOHK
During a recent discussion on X platform, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson addressed a concerned user asking whether it is true that he is leaving Cardano for another project, Midnight, or shifting to a multi-chain approach. The founder dispelled the rumors of his departure with a firm and direct ""no,"" stating that ""the hundreds of IOG engineers and scientists working on Cardano every day can confirm that."" With this statement, Hoskinson reaffirmed his commitment to Cardano and put an end to rumors concerning Midnight, a new data protection-focused blockchain that aims to safeguard sensitive commercial and personal data, ensuring fundamental freedoms for developers, companies and individuals.","['SHIBA', 'ADA', 'KSM', 'BTC', 'SHIB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9eb7d28248d6e30663aee/

South Korea wins Do Kwon extradition rights in Terra saga,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 19:04:32.714093,"Do Kwon is set to return to his native South Korea for criminal prosecution two years after the collapse of Terra’s tokens, which shook the crypto industry. 
Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon will be extradited to South Korea following a ruling by Podgorica’s High Court, according to a Mar. 6 report from local Montenegro media Pobjeda. The news came after Kwon won a third appeal to revoke his repatriation to the United States.
Kwon’s defense team, led by attorney Goran Rodic, challenged the decision announced on Feb. 21, citing judicial misconduct and political coercion. A judge ruled in favor of U.S. extradition based on the supposed order of arrival of requests.
However, an Appellate Court found that the U.S. requested temporary detention rather than full extradition after Kwon’s arrest last year. Conversely, South Korea’s Embassy and Ministry of Justice both petitioned Montenegro for Kwon’s transfer back to his home country.

It’s unknown if the former Terraform CEO will appeal extradition to South Korea at press time, but the possibility remains considering previous judgments. 
South Korean and U.S. authorities tussled for rights to Do Kwon’s extradition in connection to the multi-billion collapse of Terra, a blockchain ecosystem created by the former tycoon. Both jurisdictions have opened litigation against the founder over fraud and criminal violations in a crash that cost investors more than $60 billion.
The South Korean National Police Agency had solicited help from Interpol before the approval of Kwon’s extradition to the country, per media outlet Newsis. An ex-Terra developer testified in a South Korean court that Kwon knew the Terra project was legally questionable, crypto.news reported.

Cryptocurrency market continues to experience noteworthy developments. Following the addition of Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet to its dashboard by Arkham Intelligence, rumors are circulating about Elon Musk’s contribution to Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings. BlockFi and FTX have agreed on a settlement that could lead to full recovery for BlockFi’s creditors. Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 announced the permanent closure of its Drumheller facility in Canada, citing adverse conditions in the mining sector.
Tesla and Bitcoin Investments
After the crypto data analytics platform Arkham Intelligence added the feature to track Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet to its dashboard, Tesla’s Bitcoin assets have become a hot topic in the crypto community again. Tesla’s wallet currently holds approximately 11,509 Bitcoins, which is 1,789 more than the 9,720 Bitcoins reported in the last earnings report.
Under Musk’s leadership, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin near the peak of the last bull run in February 2021 and announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments for vehicle orders. However, the company’s adoption of Bitcoin was short-lived, and it sold about 10% of its holdings in March 2021. The electric car manufacturer sold approximately 75% of its Bitcoin reserves in the second quarter of 2022.
While some users speculate that Tesla might be buying Bitcoin and could announce it during the next earnings call, others believe it could be an accounting error.
BlockFi and FTX Reach Agreement
Bankrupt crypto firms BlockFi and FTX have reached a preliminary agreement to resolve their disputes. According to a court filing dated March 6, FTX agreed to pay up to $874.5 million to BlockFi and to drop its claims against the company. The terms of the agreement are subject to the approval of United States Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in Wilmington, Delaware.

The agreement will resolve BlockFi’s claims against FTX, totaling about a billion dollars, and will see FTX waiving millions of dollars in avoidance claims and other counterclaims against BlockFi. A claim of $689.3 million against Alameda Research for loans received from BlockFi is also emerging.
Hut 8 Takes Notable Step
Bitcoin miner Hut 8 is closing its mining facility in Alberta due to power outages and rising energy costs. The US-based miner announced on March 6 that its Drumheller mining facility in Alberta would be immediately shut down. The facility was extracting roughly 1.4% of Bitcoin but at a cost equivalent to about 11% of the hash rate. This situation proved to be unsustainable in the long run. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot stated in his announcement:

“After a comprehensive analysis, we determined that the profitability of Drumheller was significantly affected by various factors, including high energy costs and underlying voltage issues.”

The Bitcoin mining industry faces a challenging period due to rising energy costs, record mining difficulty, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will automatically reduce block rewards by 50%. For the first time in Bitcoin history, the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high before the halving event.

Investment developments in the cryptocurrency market continue to make headlines. Accordingly, a development platform focused on the Cosmos ecosystem, Cosmology, announced that it has raised $5 million in seed funding. The funding round, led by venture firms Galileo and Lemniscap, saw participation from Dispersion, HashKey, Tuesday Capital, Osmosis Foundation, Chorus One, and Informal Systems. The company did not disclose details regarding the valuation process.
Significant Step from the Cosmology Team
Cosmology aims to provide a full roll-up development environment including developer tools for Tendermint, the Cosmos SDK, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Tools like Telescope and Cosmos Kit are designed to simplify the development process for applications on the Cosmos ecosystem.
Cosmos, is an interoperability network comprising various ecosystems. These ecosystems can interact with each other through the Cosmos Hub using the IBC protocol. The firm stated that its goal is to make blockchain application development accessible to all developers interested in Cosmos and to reduce the need for expertise.

Noteworthy Details About Cosmology
It was also noted that hundreds of developers are utilizing Cosmology’s software to create decentralized finance platforms, wallets, governance tools, NFT platforms, lending platforms, futures exchange platforms, and liquid staking protocols. Among these platforms are Osmosis, Cosmostation, Stride, Juno, DaoDao, Stargaze, Leap Wallet, Persistence, Quicksilver, and many more. Dan Lynch, the founder of Cosmology, shared the following statement:

“Our mission is to empower a broad range of developers, foster innovation, and facilitate the transition from Web2 to Web3. We achieve this by enabling developers to quickly turn their ideas into implemented applications, focusing on the big picture concepts rather than the low-level technical details of the blockchain ecosystem.”

With the rise led by Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market, many altcoins also manage to make investors smile. With these developments, the crypto market is encountering significant interest from many investment firms. It seems that investment developments, often discussed during the bull market, will continue to emerge.

Elon Musk and Altcoins
Once very engaged with cryptocurrencies, Musk has fallen out with them during the recent bear market. In a Space broadcast with Wood, he mentioned that he no longer cares about cryptocurrencies as much as he used to. Despite once staunchly defending Dogecoin, he has been quiet about it for some time. However, his response to the following post caused the price of PEPE Coin to reach its daily peak.

These days, Elon Musk is closely involved with politics and the economy. The current US administration’s mistakes and the issue of illegal immigration are attracting his attention more than cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, his comment on a related criticism post caused PEPE Coin to jump to its daily peak, similar to previous instances. The price, which reached $0.00000786, has now retreated to $0.0000072.

The Bitcoin price rose by a fraction of a percentage in the last 24 hours to trade at $66,798 as of 03:31 a.m. EST on trading volume that dropped 44% to $56.16 billion.
This comes as billionaire Mark Cuban, known for his role in the reality TV show ”Shark Tank,” says that BTC is better than gold.
In an interview with CNBC, Cuban said that as an investment option he’d choose Bitcoin over gold ”all day, every day.”

Mark Cuban on CNBC: ""There’s only going to be 21 million #Bitcoin "".
Further said: ""The more people that buy and the fewer people that sell, means the price is going to go up and that's the nature of it, and it's a great store of value"".#Crypto #BitcoinETF #BTC… pic.twitter.com/BvDJqjKZzc
— Fahad Faqeeh (@FahadFaqeeh65) March 6, 2024


Cuban believes Bitcoin, with its finite supply of 21 million coins, is a superior store of value compared to gold’s potentially unlimited and unknown supply, making it a more appealing investment.





In 2022, Cuban expressed strong criticism towards gold investors, bluntly stating that they are ”dumb.” He argues that gold is an outdated investment choice and advocates for Bitcoin as the future of safe-haven investments.
Bitcoin Price Set To Break The Upper Boundary Of The Bullish Pennant




   BTCUSD Chart Analysis Source: Tradingview.com
  

Since the beginning of February, Bitcoin’s price has been on a steady rise, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $69,294. However, it subsequently retraced back to $59,000.
BTC’s resilience shines through as it stages a remarkable recovery, with bulls able to sustain the price within the confines of the bullish pennant.
BTC is trading above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), further evidence of the continued bullish sentiment. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 58, an indication that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. 
However, the RSI is moving to the north, which could be a sign of incoming intensified buying.



The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the sentiments of a looming bullish rally as it trades over the zero line. Moreover, the red bars on the histogram seem to diminish towards the neutral line, a confirmation of a rebound to the upside.
The Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (green) is trading over the trigger line (orange), representing a bullish moving average crossover, which is an encouragement for investors to buy more, as there is an impending bull rally.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
The Bitcoin price Analysis shows that BTC is currently on a bullish move as it recovers towards its set ATH of $69,294. The bulls are aiming to breach the upper boundary of the bullish pennant, supported by the golden cross at $42,875 to drive the price up, aiming at $75,000.
In case the bears take charge of the price at these levels, support levels at $61,562 and $59,380 would offer stabilization points in the event of a retracement.
As the Bitcoin price steadies after a rollercoaster week, some investors are diversifying into new ICO Green Bitcoin, which crypto analyst Jacob Bury says has the potential to surge 10X on launch.

Irish minister wants X to remove 'deeply sinister' crypto scam ads,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 19:04:44.227006,"



The legal team for Ireland’s deputy prime minister has demanded that X (formerly Twitter) remove a series of ‘deeply sinister’ crypto yX8aspJrO0 adverts featuring the prominent politician, Irish media reported today.   
Tánaiste Micheál Martin and his legal team wrote the letter to X outlining major concerns, specifically that vulnerable people will fall for the scam ads and his reputation will be damaged ahead of next year’s general election.
Sources from within Martin’s conservative Christian Fianna Fáil party told the Irish Independent that the crypto adverts on X are ‘outrageous,’ and ‘deeply sinister.’ They claim, “We are taking this very seriously and all options are on the table as far as how we might proceed.” 
Before X, Martin took Google to court over crypto scam ads
Martin previously took Google to court over a series of crypto scam adverts that used his likeness. Martin said he wanted to hold the perpetrators accountable and the High Court sided with him. Google was ordered in December to give up details of the financial accounts paying for the ads.



       Google must tell Irish politician names behind crypto scam ads
      


Read more: UK politician Zack Polanski hacked on X to promote crypto scam
Now the scam adverts Martin wants to remove are reportedly appearing regularly on X as paid-for content. The adverts, similar to the ones in the Google case, use the name of the Irish Independent and share a fake article claiming to reveal his secrets about getting rich through crypto. 
One UK victim lost £40,000 ($50,800) to a similar advert scam last year.
Martin’s solicitors have reportedly not heard anything from X after sending the letter but are still considering options on how to address the situation.

The cryptocurrency market has been subject to significant activity as Arkham Intelligence integrates tracking for Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet, sparking discussions about the electric car company’s Bitcoin assets. As of now, Tesla’s wallet holds a reported 11,509 Bitcoins. This has led to speculation over whether Tesla has resumed purchasing Bitcoin or if the apparent increase in holdings is due to a clerical mistake.
Investor Gaze Turns to Tesla
Recent analysis shows that Tesla has acquired more Bitcoin than previously disclosed, stirring investor curiosity. This revelation comes after Tesla’s initial $1.5 billion investment, a brief period of Bitcoin transactions acceptance, and the subsequent sale of a majority of its Bitcoin assets in early 2021 and mid-2022.
The crypto community is divided on whether the increased Bitcoin count in Tesla’s wallet signals new acquisitions or simply an accounting error. The next earnings update is keenly awaited for clarification.
BlockFi and FTX Settlement Progresses
In the realm of cryptocurrency finance, bankruptcy-stricken BlockFi and FTX have struck a preliminary deal. FTX has agreed to a settlement that could result in BlockFi creditors being fully reimbursed. This agreement awaits judicial approval but promises to settle the billion-dollar claims between the two firms.
Further developments include the resolution of avoidance claims and the emergence of a substantial loan repayment obligation of over $689 million from Alameda Research to BlockFi.
Hut 8 Announces Mining Facility Shutdown
In mining news, Hut 8 is shutting down its Alberta-based Drumheller facility due to untenable operational costs. The decision underscores the broader issues faced by the Bitcoin mining industry, such as high energy expenses and increased mining difficulty.
These challenges are compounded by the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is expected to further strain miners by slashing block rewards. This comes at a time when the Bitcoin price has surged to unprecedented levels prior to a halving event.

"306,676 BTC Support Might Halt Bitcoin’s Decline to $60,000, Here's How",COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 19:04:53.891656,"

  Cover image via U.Today


Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced downward pressure shortly after reaching new all-time highs on Tuesday, failing to maintain its momentum above $69,000 and falling as low as $59,313.BTC recovered from this low with a surprising drive for the crypto asset, and it has since demonstrated unusual resilience and stability above $66,000, which remains a critical support and milestone for the top cryptocurrency.
As Bitcoin remains above $66,000, Ali, a crypto expert, identifies the most crucial support for Bitcoin. A breach of this crucial support may result in selling pressure, dragging Bitcoin closer to the $60,000 mark. 
According to Ali, the important support level for Bitcoin is $66,112, as evidenced by the substantial volume of over 306,676 BTC transactions.

The key support level for #Bitcoin stands at $66,112, marked by a substantial volume of over 306,676 $BTC transactions. Should #BTC break below this pivotal threshold, eyes will turn to $60,600 as the next crucial support zone. pic.twitter.com/etuBRlvIOR— Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2024

He went on to say that if BTC falls below this critical level, the next important support zone will be $60,600.
The 306,676 BTC transaction volume at $66,112 is a solid and bullish indicator for Bitcoin, demonstrating the strength and support for the leading cryptocurrency at this crucial price level.
At the time of writing, BTC was up 1.25% in the previous 24 hours to $67,032.  Bulls appear to be attempting to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $67,000 and eventually past the recently set all-time high of $69,000.
If this is achieved, Bitcoin may begin the second leg of its ascent, reaching $76,000 and eventually $80,000.
Expectations are rising ahead of the much-anticipated halving event in April 2024. Analysts predict that rising scarcity and strong demand from individual and institutional investors will likely drive up Bitcoin's price even further. According to researchers, based on historical trends since the halving, Bitcoin's price might reach $150,000 within the next year.
However, previous performance does not guarantee future returns. That said, the magnitude of Bitcoin's gains before and after the halving event remains unknown. ","['2024', '2024', 'BTC', 'APRIL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e6d3e0f8a513810944f5/
Interesting Price Action on BONK and Other Solana Memecoins Have Led Investors To Possible 50x on Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ),COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 19:04:55.963573,"TLDR

BONK pumps 118% in a week, but experts believe a retracement is in store. 
Rebel Satoshi continues making waves after completing its public presale. 

Bonk (BONK) and other Solana-based meme coins have performed exemplarily over the past week. Meanwhile, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), an upcoming meme coin, has emerged as a significant rival for top altcoins after generating a 150% presale ROI and promising massive post-presale gains. Which cryptocurrency promises the best returns between BONK and Rebel Satoshi? Read on to find out!
BONK Jumps 118% in a Week: More Growth Coming?
BONK has performed incredibly well over the past week. On February 26, BONK was hovering around $0.00001194. After trading sideways for days, BONK gained traction on February 28 due to an overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Specifically, Bitcoin (BTC) jumped as high as $64,065, triggering massive gains in top crypto coins.

Additionally, Bybit integrated BONK in its Solana Fiesta, which has a $120,000 prize pool. As a result, more investors embraced BONK, pushing its price higher. The resulting uptrend saw BONK jump as high as $0.00002880 on March 2 before leveling off at around $0.00002614 as of March 3. This price means BONK has gained 118.93% in a week.
Based on this performance, is BONK a good crypto to buy now? According to experts, BONK will pull back as the supremacy battle among meme coins intensifies. To this end, experts set the end-of-year BONK prediction at $0.00001890. 



Rebel Satoshi Shines Bright After Concluding Its Presale!
Rebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin that seeks to fight centralization in the crypto industry, has taken the crypto market by storm after completing its presale in less than four months. This budding meme coin project has achieved this milestone due to increasing demand for its governance and membership token, dubbed $RBLZ. 
Investors are purchasing $RBLZ because it features a reasonable supply of 250 million tokens and a deflationary mechanism. On top of this, $RBLZ grants investors access to the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem. Once complete, the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem will feature a P2E game, an NFT marketplace, and a stake-to-earn program.
As of March, Rebel Satoshi had concluded its presale. Notably, $RBLZ’s price had increased to $0.025. By attaining this price, $RBLZ has generated a 150% ROI for Early Bird Round investors who bought it at $0.010. Additionally, $RBLZ has been listed on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, and Coinstore, a leading centralized exchange.
Moreover, experts believe getting listed on exchanges will expose $RBLZ to more investors, a feat that can push its price 50x up. To this end, experts believe $RBLZ is the best cryptocurrency to buy today!

A “crypto investor” could invest in any or all of the different types of cryptos. Memecoins were a popular type in the past before a decline in popularity but they could be making a resurgence with coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) gaining some 120% recently.
Options like Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) are also making an interesting comeback. We find out how much of this is reactionary and FOMO and whether they are worth going for. We also check the token that investors from both coins are buying, Kelexo (KLXO).
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Takes Off
Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are ecstatic as the token’s price skyrockets in a few days. Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw an unexpected spike that saw it go up to 2x in value in a matter of days. Among memecoins and all cryptos in fact, this is one of the biggest rises in the bull run.
It is still growing, although slower than before. Shiba Inu (SHIB) came in at $0.00003163 at press time, 200% ahead of prices 7 days ago.
A Quick End to Ripple’s (XRP) Resurgence?
Ripple (XRP) picked up in the bull run and looked set to hit new heights. A 15% rise from the end of February to the 3rd of March fueled this even more as Ripple (XRP) clinched the $0.66 position. However, not much has happened since then as Ripple (XRP) stays at the $0.6218 position at the time of writing.
It has actually started to decline but not significantly. Ripple (XRP) should remain clear of support levels but may be unable to break $0.65 again.
Litecoin (LTC) to $100?
At press time, Litecoin (LTC) trades below $90 but could be on its way to $100. The token has already added 17% compared to the last few days of February. Litecoin (LTC) has also increased by 28% tracing back to 30 days ago.
$100 is the next significant milestone and Litecoin (LTC) has crossed it in the past its all-time high is more than 4 times that value. However, much skepticism accompanies it this time.
Kelexo (KLXO) Emerges As Major Option for Investors
We have come to understand that many investors now consider a decentralized loan service, Kelexo (KLXO) is now a strong alternative for many investors. Users already have much to gain from the platform but investors are buying in before its launch. They could see many benefits themselves.
Kelexo (KLXO) is priced at just $0.028 and has a predicted value of over 30x in a year. Experienced investors do not miss opportunities like this and are buying in quickly. Kelexo (KLXO) will also set aside some of its revenue to reward presale investors based on their holdings.
Attractive returns, amazing real-world utility and protection for investors all contribute to the popularity of Kelexo (KLXO). Investors are claiming much of its 440 million supply early to get the best out of it.

Bitcoin and Gold Hit Record Highs: Insights from Gareth Soloway,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 19:05:01.013991,"In a special episode of “On the Spot” filmed in Tampa, Florida, Michelle McCory had the opportunity to sit down with Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at Verified Investing. The timing couldn’t have been more fortuitous, as both Bitcoin and gold reached new all-time highs on the same day. Soloway shared his insights on this unique market scenario and the potential implications for investors.
A Tale of Two Assets: Gold and Bitcoin
Traditionally, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, a refuge in times of market uncertainty. In contrast, Bitcoin, despite efforts by enthusiasts to brand it as a store of value, is widely regarded as a high-risk, volatile investment. The simultaneous surge in prices of these two assets, according to Soloway, reflects a peculiar market environment.
The recent rally in Bitcoin can be attributed to a risk-on market sentiment, with investors gravitating towards high-risk assets. This trend has been evident in the stock market, particularly in the tech sector, with companies like Nvidia and the overall NASDAQ index reaching new heights. The excitement surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has also fueled investor enthusiasm, reminiscent of the speculative frenzy seen in assets like GameStop and AMC.
On the other hand, gold’s resilience and its recent push to new highs can be linked to sustained buying by central banks. Despite the risk-on environment, gold has not retreated significantly from its peak, which Soloway interprets as a sign of smart money hedging against a potential bubble in risk assets.

The Interplay of Market Forces
Soloway warns that Bitcoin could face significant downside if the stock market experiences a sharp sell-off. He highlights the correlation between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ, noting that a downturn in the stock market could lead to a substantial correction in Bitcoin prices.
Furthermore, Soloway discusses the impact of leverage in the cryptocurrency market, which can exacerbate price fluctuations. He contrasts this with the traditional stock market, where leverage is more constrained.
Looking ahead, Soloway remains cautious about Bitcoin’s prospects in the event of a broader market correction. He suggests that if the risk-off sentiment takes hold, Bitcoin could retrace to levels around $30,000 to $32,000.
Gold’s Brightening Prospects
In the realm of gold, Soloway sees a brighter future. He believes that smart money is increasingly rotating into gold as a hedge against potential bubbles in risk assets. The recent breakout in gold prices, driven by momentum, is a testament to this shift.
As for gold miners, Soloway points out that they have faced challenges due to rising costs. However, if gold prices continue to outpace inflation, their profitability could improve significantly, leading to outperformance in the sector.
A Look Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty
In the broader market, Soloway anticipates challenges ahead, particularly with government spending and inflationary pressures. He expresses concern over the sustainability of current fiscal policies and the potential implications for the economy and financial markets.
Despite the near-term allure of Bitcoin, Soloway advises caution, noting that signs of speculative excess often precede market corrections. He underscores the importance of being prepared for a range of outcomes, including geopolitical tensions and unexpected events.
Our Take on It
Gareth Soloway’s insights shed light on the complex dynamics driving the current market landscape. We’d like to add a few more points this analysis, in regards to Bitcoin cycles.
The behavior of Bitcoin after reaching new highs is crucial in understanding market dynamics. Historically, after breaching all-time highs, the market tends to heat up quickly. If this trend continues, it could lead to a peak in Q4 of 2025, aligning with previous cycles. However, the current cycle’s unique characteristics, combined with the influence of monetary policy, add layers of complexity to this prediction.
The correlation between Bitcoin’s performance and other economic indicators, such as gold prices and the labor market, further complicates the analysis. For instance, gold’s breakout in 2019 coincided with a peak in Bitcoin, suggesting a potential cooling-off period for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the labor market’s strength, particularly the unemployment rate, could play a significant role in Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

Expert Predicts Bitcoin’s Next Stop As $300K in 2024,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Coin Edition,2024-03-07 19:05:02.832320,"
Robert Kiyosaki has predicted Bitcoin’s next target in 2024 as $300,000.
Bitcoin has accumulated a 180% profit from September 2023.
Funds inflow into Bitcoin increased significantly after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Renowned investor and famous entrepreneur Robert Kiyosaki has predicted Bitcoin’s next target as $300,000. Kiyosaki stated this in a recent post on X, where he advised his followers to invest in the flagship cryptocurrency, even in small amounts.



BITCOIN on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500. Next stop $300,000 per BC in 2024— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 6, 2024




According to Kiyosaki, “Bitcoin is on Fire,” and the biggest mistake anyone can make is procrastinating. The renowned investment educator noted that it is crucial to start investing in the topmost cryptocurrency, even with only $500. He not only predicted a $300,000 target for Bitcoin but said it would happen this year.
Kiyosaki’s comments come after Bitcoin displayed significant bullish strength, with a consistent rally for the past six months. The pioneer crypto has registered bulli…

Arkham’s on-chain analysis found that Bitcoin transactions and flows were identical to SpaceX and Tesla’s balance sheets. The data shows that Tesla purchased $1.5 billion of BTC in January 2021. 
Just two months after that, the automobile giants briefly allowed the purchase of Tesla in Bitcoin. Tesla’s BTC holdings have increased since then, as a large cluster of the current holdings seems related to a particular car sale.

Tesla only sold its BTC portfolio on two occasions, one in the first half of 2021 and another in 2022. The company sold a large chunk of BTC worth $936 million in the second quarter of 2022, at the beginning of the bear market, when Bitcoin began dipping below $40,000. Tesla currently holds just over $772 million in BTC.



SpaceX also acquired Bitcoin in 2021 and sold it for around $450 million in 2022. The company currently holds over $555 million in BTC. 
The figures would make Tesla and SpaceX the third and fifth largest Bitcoin holders. However, cumulatively, this makes Elon Musk’s ventures the second largest BTC holders after MicroStrategy. The largest cryptocurrency remains bullish, reaching $68,000 again today after hitting its all-time high last week.

In a bold move, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) went on a buying spree Tuesday, gobbling up over $778 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) as the world's largest cryptocurrency experienced a price dip. The fund's investors appear to have seized the opportunity to accumulate more BTC at a discounted rate, signaling confidence in the long-term prospects of the digital asset.
The massive purchase underscores the growing institutional interest in bitcoin and the increasing acceptance of crypto-based investment vehicles. ETFs like IBIT provide a regulated and convenient way for investors to gain exposure to the volatile but potentially lucrative cryptocurrency market without directly holding the assets themselves.

France: Zama startup raises $73 million to revolutionize crypto!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointribune EN,2024-03-07 19:05:08.053396,"The crypto world has been shaken by a groundbreaking announcement. Zama, a French startup, has successfully raised $73 million during a Series A funding round. With this historic financing, Zama positions itself as a key player in the quest for cutting-edge privacy solutions for blockchain and artificial intelligence ecosystems.
FHE, the Keystone of Digital Privacy
At the heart of Zama’s strategy lies FHE, a major breakthrough in the field of cryptography. Unlike traditional encryption methods, FHE allows calculations and operations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt them first. 




This technical feat offers an unprecedented level of privacy. It paves the way for revolutionary applications in fields such as finance, healthcare, and national security.
A Record Funding to Accelerate Crypto Innovation
The $73 million Series A funding round, led by major players including Capital, Protocol Labs, and Gavin Wood, co-founder of Polkadot, represents a true springboard for Zama. 
With these substantial resources, the startup will be able to expedite the development of its FHE-based applications. But also to leverage the expertise of its seasoned investors in the field of cryptography.
The Promising Future of Zama’s FHE in Blockchain and AI
One of the most promising applications of FHE is its potential to transform blockchain and artificial intelligence ecosystems. In the blockchain world, FHE could enable fully confidential transactions, protecting the privacy of crypto users while maintaining the transparency and immutability inherent to the technology. 
Furthermore, in the field of AI, FHE provides the capability to train and execute machine learning models on encrypted data, thus addressing concerns related to the privacy of sensitive data.
With this record fundraising of 73 million dollars, Zama positions itself as a pivotal player in the race for digital privacy. By harnessing the revolutionary potential of FHE, this French crypto startup could well redefine data security standards in key areas such as blockchain and AI. However, beyond the commercial implications, Zama’s true impact lies in its ability to offer innovative solutions to protect the privacy of individuals and businesses in an increasingly data-driven world.","['AI', 'FTR']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e595c4f0aa6ee7ac2b70/

"2013 Dogecoin wallet back in action, is it going to sell?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Todayq News,2024-03-07 19:05:13.633357,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been in the light for some time now and no wonder something like this happened. The popular blockchain tracker WhaleAlert reported that an ancient Dogecoin wallet is back online. It was last seen active during Satoshi Nakamoto’s time. In 2010, he disappeared from public view thinking it was best for Bitcoin’s future. The awakened wallet dates back to late 2013, making its owner an early DOGE holder. Awakening of a dormant Dogecoin wallet 
According to a recent tweet from the blockchain tracker, the revived Dogecoin address now holds 747,645 DOGE, valued at $114,988 as of now. This address saw a minor transfer of 100 DOGE to another undisclosed wallet.
This move comes amidst a downturn in DOGE’s price. Following its peak of $0.2 on March 5, the meme-based cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline of 38%, dropping to $0.1285. Even so, DOGE did not lose its spotlight, which might also be another reason for the awakening.
Despite this recent slump, DOGE has seen yet another 8% decrease over the last 24 hours but still managed a 19% increase over the past week, as per data fromCoinMarketCap. At present, the coin is trading at $0.1535. The aforementioned peak marked DOGE’s highest value in three years, coinciding with a surge in Bitcoin which reached an all-time high of $69,200. Lots of whale transaction reports 
Whale Alert has also made waves recently by reporting the transfer of a staggering 1.5 billion Dogecoin by anonymous crypto whales to and from Robinhood. Robinhood, known for its offerings in both crypto and traditional company shares, witnessed three significant transactions. 
🚨 🚨 256,396,141
The largest among them involved the transfer of 500 million DOGE, while the other two involved 300,000,000 and 256,396,141 DOGE respectively. In total, these transactions amounted to a whopping $167.4 million in fiat.
Aside from that, Shiba Inu (SHIB) wants to compete with Dogecoin in the meme coin niche. Previously, Kusama teased Dogecoin enthusiasts about Shiba Inu’s intention to challenge Dogecoin’s market dominance, calling SHIB a “Dogecoin killer.” It remains yet to be seen what comes out of this ‘not so serious’ rivalry. 
As of now, the meme market cap stands at $54.9 billion reflecting a decrease of 3.5% over the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGecko. Despite the rivalry, the market is dominated by DOGE with Shiba Inu just behind it.

Meme Moguls, a highly anticipated meme coin, concluded its presale and was listed on Uniswap earlier this week. However, things went south quickly, leaving investors with a sour taste.Meme Meme Moguls Listing MayhemSeveral investors poured their heart and soul into Meme Moguls listing, enticed by the promise of high returns and a booming meme coin market. However, upon listing, the coin’s hype plummeted, leaving many feeling betrayed and questioning the investment.Meme Moguls (MGLS) is on Uniswap and its investors scrambled to recoup their losses, another project emerged as a potential saviour: BlockDAG. This innovative project, built on a revolutionary new blockchain technology, currently hosts its presale batch 2.Why BlockDAG?Scarcity and Value is one the top reasons as BlockDAG understands the importance of limited supply. A capped total of 50 billion coins ensures a controlled environment, preventing inflation and fostering a predictable landscape for their community.The platform puts its community first with 70% of the total coin supply allocated to the community, demonstrating BlockDAG’s commitment to its users and supporters. For instance, miners are rewarded for being the backbone of the network.Community Building & Ecosystem is also focused on fueling a thriving and engaging community. BlockDAG is one step ahead with the liquidity pool to guarantee smooth and stable trading experiences.Is BlockDAG presale the saviour?Investors are presented with a whole new presale experience by being early investors to join a passionate community by participating in BlockDAG’s presale batch 2. This allows everyone to be part of something groundbreaking before it explodes onto the mainstream scene.The platform and its rapidly multiplying community view the presale as more than just fundraising; it’s about building the foundation. By participating in the presale, each investor becomes an early bird and plays a crucial role in shaping the future of BlockDAG and joining a passionate group of individuals who share our vision and are committed to the project’s success.The team is one of the core attributes that lead to any project’s success, and BlockDAG has ensured the maintenance of a transparent team. BlockDAG’s team, the driving force behind the project, holds 10% of the total coin supply, further demonstrating their dedication to the project’s long-term success. Moreover, these coins are locked for 2 years, showcasing their unwavering commitment.BlockDAG: More Than Just TokenomicsBlockDAG’s tokenomics are just one piece of the puzzle. They represent a transparent commitment to every stakeholder, from miners and developers to believers in their vision. This is the blueprint for building the future of crypto, and it is openly inviting investors to be a part of it.The recent volatility in the meme coin market is a solid reminder of the inherent risks involved in investments. While Meme Moguls (MGLS) is on Uniswap and did experience initial hype, it eventually died down, so hold on to projects with a stable ecosystem like BlockDAG for long-term profit.However, amidst the chaos, innovative projects like BlockDAG offer a glimpse of hope.

Introducting Mainsail's Early Testnet,COIN_MARKET_CAP,ARK Ecosystem,2024-03-07 19:05:15.910116,"We are pleased to introduce our initial Mainsail testnet. Over the past few weeks, we have intensively prepared all the necessary tools and documentation for the public release of Mainsail testnet. With this announcement, we extend an invitation to anyone interested in familiarizing themselves with the platform or assisting in issue discovery to join us on this new journey.Mainsail has undergone development for some time now, reaching a stage where we seek initial feedback from the community and delegates to enhance its security and prepare for production.Important Links To Get StartedFor those eager to learn more about Mainsail requirements and the process of setting up a node or registering a validator, we have compiled a set of useful links in our Mainsail documentation:General introduction with some basic links for testing Requirements for running a node on Mainsail Basic network information for testnet (Files, Ports, API Nodes) Guide on operating Mainsail Transaction Tester CLI tool Utilizing TX Tester CLI tool to register as a Validator Node install script for Mainsail (recommended) Docker installation instructions for Mainsail Setting up IP Tables on Mainsail node for extra security Setting up IP Tables for nodes running API server General InformationThe testnet has been operational internally for several months, during which we addressed issues as they arose. While it has been running smoothly without significant problems, we now seek broader engagement to ensure its robustness and stability. Thus, we have reset the network and encourage active participation in testing.For the initial testnet, we have prepared:ARK Scan - a blockchain explorer compatible with Mainsail.Documentation - essential guides for setting up nodes, registering delegates, and more.CLI Tool - tools aiding in transaction testing and delegate registration.Faucet - a resource for receiving tokens for testing purposes, facilitating transaction testing and validator registration.This blog post covers how to get started and highlights the major changes users may notice in this early stage.Looking ahead, we plan to transition away from the term ‘Delegate’ in favor of ‘Validator,’ a more widely recognized term in the market. This transition is already reflected in the codebase and documentation, though not yet in our user interfaces, which we will update in the coming months for full compatibility with Mainsail. Additionally, we introduced ‘Usernames,’ allowing users to register a username for a desired address to enhance recognizability. Unlike validators, who can actively participate in the network, usernames open up different use cases.Here’s a quick breakdown of the most notable backend, node and validator setup changes:Introducing a (2-stage) BFT consensus mechanism with instant block finality.The Public API is now operated as a separate process and made optional.Transactions are now broadcasted using a different port; the previous port (4003) has been replaced with the new port (4007). Additionally, the P2P has moved from port 4001 to port 4000.Validators are now required to register a dedicated private key for block validations.To avoid a three-way split since peers are no longer part of the quorum, the number of validators has been increased to 53 from the previous count of 51, ensuring a prime number.The availability of on-chain usernames has been added to all addresses through a dedicated username registration transaction.In this early testnet phase, we support the following transactions:Transfers - standard transfers between addresses.Multipayments - simultaneous transfers to two or more addresses in a single transaction.Vote - casting a vote for a preferred validator using addresses balance.Unvote - retracting a vote from a validator.Switch Vote - changing the vote from one validator to another within the same transaction.Validator Registration - registering a validator with a chosen name.Validator Resignation - resigning from the role of validator, rendering the address ineligible for block production and getting new votes.Username Registration - introducing usernames, allowing users to register a username for an address.Username Resignation - similar to validator resignation, allowing users to resign a username.Multisignature Registration - registering an address as a multisignature address for collaborative transactions.Testnet FaucetUsers can request 100 DARK tokens for the Mainsail network on the Mainsail DARK Faucet  app to begin testing. Simply provide your DARK address, and the faucet will promptly send 100 DARK tokens to the specified address.ARK ScanBasic support for Mainsail has been integrated into the Mainsail Testnet Explorer .Please note that this integration is still a work in progress, and certain features may not be fully supported or implemented yet, including:Validators are referred to as Delegates.Potential inaccuracies in voter count due to voting and unvoting activities.Optional usernames may result in blank displays in some instances rather than falling back to other identifiers such as public keys.Display of current supply excludes newly forged coins.We’ll be working on addressing all of the above and other issues in the upcoming weeks.Mainsail CLI Transaction TesterFor initial testing, we’ve developed a straightforward CLI tool that enables you to interact with the network seamlessly. Dive into the Mainsail TX Tester repository  and read over Mainsail TX Tester documentation  to learn more.This tool empowers you to:Generate new addresses (random or custom mnemonic).Create and broadcast transfers to specified addresses.Register as a validator.Have A Question or Want To Report An Issue?Should you encounter queries about the Mainsail setup or identify issues during testing, don’t hesitate to reach out through either of the following avenues:Open an issue on our GitHub Repository at Mainsail repository .Join our community-driven Discord and hop into the #mainsail_testnet channel. You can access the server here .As this marks an early stage of Mainsail and our testnet, we haven’t allocated any bounties specifically for reporting bugs or security vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we encourage active participation and looking over the codebase to enhance its resilience and efficiency. Your contributions are invaluable as we strive to refine and strengthen Mainsail for future iterations.What’s Next?In the upcoming weeks, we encourage users to join the network and help run public nodes. This will offer insights into real-life usage scenarios with a broader user base.On the development front, our next milestone involves integrating ARK Vault with Mainsail, facilitating broader participation in regular testing activities like transaction sending, username registration, validator registration, resigning, and more.We remain committed to enhancing the overall Mainsail codebase based on user feedback and addressing any issues that surface. Additionally, our team will continue progressing with the EVM feature implementation.In light of substantial architectural shifts in Mainsail, particularly when compared with Core v3, we are set to write a dedicated, in-depth blog post. This post aims to provide a detailed comparison, going into the general improvements, inner workings of the updated consensus mechanism featuring finalization, the introduction of new dedicated validator keys, API architecture and more. Stay tuned for an insightful exploration of these transformative changes!Follow on Twitter (X)Stay connected with us on X  (formerly Twitter) and keep an eye on our blog for the latest Mainsail updates and other developments within the ARK Ecosystem.Share:",['ARK'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e3afe837342a9e18a164/

Hashing It Out: Will 2024 be the best year for DeFi yet?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 19:05:18.039167,"In the 50th episode of the Hashing It Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw speaks with Sonali Giovino, global head of ecosystems at De.Fi, about the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As the crypto space sees signs of a potential bull run, Giovino breaks down the power of DeFi, the problems associated with the sector, and how they could impact mass adoption in the coming years.
Giovino believes the groundwork has been laid for exponential growth in the decentralized finance world as the market turns green. However, she also explains that now is the most important time to consider the various risks that cut across the DeFi sector, from security to regulations.


Giovino explains that security has always been the biggest risk, with many smart contract vulnerabilities having led to major losses over the years. She adds that until recently, there was not enough attention given to DeFi security issues. This is changing as more developers work with auditors, more companies build security tools for users, and more events focus on DeFi security.
Despite the risks, Giovino says people are encouraged to venture into DeFi because it is empowering:

 “I think sometimes people are concerned about getting into the DeFi space because of the crypto scams or, you know, the volatility and the risk. But one of the things I have to encourage and really enlighten is that DeFi is not only disruptive, but it’s extremely empowering. It empowers people around the world to create solutions and to tackle some of these issues that, of course, affect everybody.”

Crypto Markets Anticipate Major Updates as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Approaches,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 19:05:19.207386,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Crypto Markets Anticipate Major Updates as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Approaches
In a crucial week for cryptocurrency investors, eyes are set on the impending Ethereum Dencun upgrade, expected to significantly impact the market. This layer2 scaling solution is poised to slash transaction fees and enhance network capacity, potentially fostering growth in total value locked and user activity. This expansion could, in turn, lift the value of associated tokens.
Ethereum’s Dencun: A Game Changer for Transaction Costs
Ethereum’s network is set to adopt the Dencun hard fork, a much-anticipated layer2 scaling solution, which is predicted to transform the blockchain’s transaction efficiency. By reducing fees and accommodating more network activities, the upgrade could accelerate the growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem, thereby boosting token prices.
Implications for Layer2 Protocols and Altcoins
David Silverman of Polygon Labs has indicated that the effects of the upgrade on layer2 protocols will be observable by the end of March. As these protocols implement the update, altcoins such as MATIC could see substantial benefits and potentially outperform in the market.
The Dencun hard fork is composed of nine improvement proposals and marks a significant evolution in the Ethereum infrastructure with a nod to a multi-chain future. Silverman highlights Ethereum’s commitment to rollup-centric solutions, aiming to decentralize scaling responsibilities and enhance user experiences.
As the cryptocurrency space watches the Ethereum upgrade, layer2 solutions like Arbitrum, Starknet, Polygon, and OP Token are among the altcoins that could experience a positive impact. With the integration of these updates, they are positioned for a potential rise by month-end.

  Cover image via U.Today


XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, has seen a spectacular increase in adoption and distribution, with over five million accounts currently holding 59.8 billion XRP, according to the most recent data from Xrpl Services, an XRP Ledger explorer.
According to data from the Xrpl services platform, there are 5,089,197 XRP accounts. The number of accounts with zero balances is 1,592. This means that 59,879,274,264 XRP are held in roughly five million accounts, demonstrating increased demand and interest in the digital asset.
In 2023, a U.S. judge determined that XRP is not a security in and of itself, giving the cryptocurrency regulatory certainty.
The sixth-largest cryptocurrency has also benefited from the overall bullish sentiment and momentum on the crypto market, which has seen the total market cap surpass $2 trillion and the Bitcoin price reach all-time highs of over $69,000.
Even though the XRP price has relatively underperformed in comparison to other altcoins, the data revealing the number of accounts and total XRP holdings might reveal resilience on the part of XRP holders.
XRP continues to benefit from rising interest and demand from institutional investors, who have flocked to the crypto space in pursuit of alternative and innovative assets, triggering $2.5 million in inflows in the past week, per the latest CoinShares report.
XRP price action
At the time of writing, XRP had risen 4.26% in the previous 24 hours to $0.628 in its second day of recovery following its sharp plunge on March 5. XRP hit intraday highs of $0.63, with the next goal of $0.67.
XRP fell from $0.67 on March 5, signaling that bears are vigorously defending the price.
The bears will once again attempt to defend the $0.67 level. If they do so, it will signal range-bound action shortly. XRP may fluctuate between the 50-day SMA and $0.67 for a little while.
The price recovered from the 50-day SMA of $0.547, indicating that bulls continue to buy on strong falls. XRP might make one more try to overcome the overhead barrier at $0.67 and begin its rise to $0.74.","['BTC', 'MM', 'EPIC', 'XRP', 'BILL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e33ec4f0aa6ee7ac2b62/
Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX Bitcoin Holdings Uncovered: Data,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 19:05:22.198315,"

  Cover image via U.Today


In a shocking revelation for the crypto industry, data from the blockchain analysis platform Arkham revealed the magnitude of Bitcoin (BTC) owned by Elon Musk's firms Tesla and SpaceX. 
Tesla's and SpaceX's Bitcoin holdings
According to a recent post on X, Arkham unveiled that Tesla currently holds 11,510 BTC, valued at approximately $780 million, distributed across 68 addresses.
Additionally, the data also shows that SpaceX boasts its own Bitcoin treasure chest, with holdings totaling 8,290 BTC, valued at approximately $560 million, dispersed across 28 addresses.
What makes this revelation even more surprising is that it contradicts Tesla's earlier disclosure in its Q4 report, where it claimed to possess 9,720 BTC. Arkham's findings suggest that Tesla's Bitcoin holdings have exceeded the previously reported figure, implying a potentially larger investment in the cryptocurrency than previously disclosed.
Tesla's journey into the world of Bitcoin began in February 2021 when the company made headlines by investing a substantial $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. This action sent ripples through the crypto space, catapulting Bitcoin's value to new highs. 
However, Arkham noted in its recent report that Tesla divested a portion of its holdings, selling $272 million worth of Bitcoin in Q1, 2021, and $936 million in Q2, 2022. Interestingly, Arkham's Tesla Intel Exchange Bounty uncovered a Tesla car purchase linked to the larger cluster of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings, providing additional validation for the platform's findings.
Musk's stance on cryptocurrency
Despite his endorsement of Bitcoin, Elon Musk remains somewhat hesitant toward cryptocurrency as a whole. When questioned about its impact on the monetary system by Cathie Wood, Musk admitted to spending little time pondering cryptocurrency but expressed a keen interest in understanding the nature of money itself. 
Notably, Musk has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin, often referring to it as the ""people's money"" and endorsing it through various means, including social media.","['28', 'BTC', 'ARKM', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e33ec4f0aa6ee7ac2b64/
Reviving Retail Interest Propels Bitcoin Trading to Yearly Peak,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 19:05:23.205534,"Key Points

Bitcoin’s spot trading volume recorded a yearly high of $46.26 billion on March 5, indicating increased retail investor interest.
The number of Bitcoin addresses with a minimum of $10 worth reached a new all-time high, further suggesting increased retail investor participation.

Bitcoin’s spot trading volume on centralized exchanges hit a yearly high on March 5, with a combined daily volume of $46.26 billion. This suggests an influx of retail investors purchasing the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.
Spot Trading Volume High
The volume of Bitcoin spot trading cooled slightly to $31.32 billion the following day. Binance accounted for over 74% or $18 billion of this total.
According to Mallika Kollar, a quantitative research associate at Bitwise, spot trading volume has surged nearly 680% since the beginning of the year, indicating a significant uptick in Bitcoin purchases.
Record Trading Volumes and Prices
The record trading volume coincided with a new all-time high in daily inflows for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ten U.S. Bitcoin ETFs set a record of $10 billion in daily trading volume on March 5, surpassing the previous week’s record of $7.7 billion.
These remarkable figures propelled Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high of over $69,200 on March 5. As of 1:30 pm (UTC), Bitcoin was trading at $66,878, reflecting a 1.09% increase in the preceding 24 hours.
In South Korea, Bitcoin’s price surged to as high as $72,000 on Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This price difference, known as the Kimchi Premium or Korea Premium Index, has been trending upward alongside Bitcoin’s price since early February.
The number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least $10 worth of the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of over 35 million on March 6. This further indicates increased retail investor participation. Similarly, online search trends for Bitcoin remain high, with worldwide searches averaging 80 between March 3 and March 9, a 31% increase from the previous year.
The number of Bitcoin transfers to Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange, is also on the rise, indicating that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking at the current price levels. However, it’s important to note that previous spikes have not only occurred during bull market tops, as seen in 2016-17.","['BTC', 'SPOT']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e340e0f8a513810944ea/
Next Stop for Cryptocurrencies: Where Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Heading?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 19:05:24.394512,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Next Stop for Cryptocurrencies: Where Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Heading?
Cryptocurrency investors are facing an extremely important week, which includes some of the most significant days of March. Alongside upcoming macroeconomic data, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will serve as a pivotal milestone. So why is Dencun important, and which altcoins, besides Ether, will benefit from it?
What is Ethereum Dencun?
Ethereum will celebrate the Dencun hard fork, a layer2 scaling solution, when it reaches the mainnet. The reason is clear: transaction costs will significantly decrease, and network activities will greatly expand. This means a rapid growth in the Total Value Locked (TVL) and active user charts. Indirectly, this will also help to increase token prices.

David Silverman, Vice President of Product at Polygon Labs, said that the latest update will start to be implemented by layer2 protocols within weeks. That means we will begin to see the results clearly by the end of March, starting from the 13th. As a result, many altcoins, including MATIC Coin, will have the opportunity to positively diverge during this process.

“In about a month and a half or two, every L2 that wants to use the blob space as a rollup will transition, and then users will see all the benefits.”

The Dencun hard fork includes nine different improvement proposals and is named Dencun as a combination of Ethereum’s execution layer upgrade Cancun and the consensus layer upgrade Deneb.
Layer2 Altcoins Set to Rise
The multi-chain future tells us a lot about today’s world, where Layer2 solutions cluster around Ethereum. David Silverman states that with the latest update, Ethereum has now clearly embraced this concept.

“This is an Ethereum roadmap item that says the future is really in rollups, as opposed to the base network being responsible for scaling. We will make changes to make them cheaper and more attractive for users and to become the standard carrier for Ethereum.”

The following altcoins are the most popular Ethereum l2 solutions and could benefit positively from the process by the end of March;

Arbitrum (ARB)
Starknet (STRK)
Polygon (MATIC)
OP Token

And there are many more cryptocurrencies.

Worldcoin refutes AEPD claims concerning Spanish ban,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 19:05:26.066400,"Worldcoin Data Protection Officer Jannick Preiwisch has countered the Spanish Data Protection Agency’s claims concerning the project’s ban in Spain.
On Mar. 6, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) ordered Worldcoin (WLD) to cease data collection and processing for up to three months due to complaints regarding insufficient information, data collection from minors, and the inability to withdraw consent.
Worldcoin, a digital ID cryptocurrency venture created by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has been temporarily banned in Spain due to concerns over how the company’s eyeball-scanning technology collected and processed biometric data.
Worldcoin’s World ID necessitates users to scan their irises using orbs. The device captures an image of the irises before users obtain a unique form of identification and the Worldcoin cryptocurrency. 
However, the AEPD has instructed Tools for Humanity, the company responsible for collecting and processing user data, to halt the collection of additional data for new users in the country and cease using the data already gathered by Worldcoin.
The agency emphasized that processing biometric data demands “special protection” due to the “high risks to the rights of individuals,” which include potential data transfers to third parties.
Earlier today, Preiwisch, the Data Protection Officer at the Worldcoin Foundation, emailed crypto.news that the company is eager to dispel any false claims made by the AEPD. 

“It is unfortunate that the Spanish data protection authority (AEPD) is circumventing established procedures under GDPR with their actions today, which are limited to Spain and not the broader EU. Additionally, It is also unfortunate that they are spreading inaccurate and misleading claims about our technology globally after our efforts to provide them with an accurate view of Worldcoin and World ID have gone unanswered for months. We are grateful to now have the opportunity to help the AEPD better understand the important facts regarding this essential and lawful technology.” Jannick Preiwisch, Data Protection Officer, Worldcoin Foundation

In recent weeks, privacy experts have criticized Worldcoin, expressing concerns that the company may utilize the collected information for purposes such as personalized marketing.
The ban in Spain mirrors a similar suspension in Kenya, where the local data protection authority banned Worldcoin’s processing activities, and the government mandated the suspension of eye scans. Worldcoin has also encountered technical issues since its launch, with some users reporting difficulties in claiming tokens after undergoing eye scans.

Worldcoin’s technical and regulatory hurdles 
Worldcoin has faced a series of controversies and challenges that have drawn attention from both users and regulators.
MIT Technology Review investigations have uncovered troubling findings about Worldcoin’s marketing practices. Allegations of deceptive marketing, excessive data collection beyond disclosed limits, and inadequate informed consent procedures have raised concerns about the project’s transparency and user privacy protections.
Additionally, Worldcoin faced scrutiny over its handling of Sybil attacks, a security threat where a single entity creates and controls multiple fake accounts within a network. Questions have been raised about the project’s approach to preventing such attacks, especially in decentralized networks where maintaining pseudonymity is crucial for trust.
On Jan. 31, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) in Hong Kong announced that it had executed raids on six premises associated with Worldcoin in the city to gather documents and information about Worldcoin’s operations. 
These developments highlight the multifaceted challenges Worldcoin faces as it grapples with controversies surrounding privacy, marketing ethics, security vulnerabilities, and market fluctuations.
WLD is trading at $7.20 when writing, representing an 8% price rise in the last 24 hours.

The Arizona State Senate passed a resolution to encourage state pensions to consider adding spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and other digital asset ETFs into their investment portfolios.
The resolution urges the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) and the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) to consider the implications of adding digital asset ETFs to their investment mix.
It also asks them to closely monitor developments in Bitcoin ETFs and other digital asset ETFs and to consult with the fund management firms that manage such investment vehicles.
It then wants them to submit a comprehensive report on the feasibility, risk and potential benefits of directing a portion of state retirement system monies into digital asset ETFs.

Solana faces investor exodus; emerging AI crypto aims to surpass Quant by the next Bitcoin halving,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 19:05:29.085301,"
The Solana network recently encountered a significant setback, enduring a 5-hour outage that precipitated a staggering $3 million exodus of investors. The outage was attributed to a bug, triggering an infinite loop within cryptocurrency transactions. Concurrently, InQubeta (QUBE), a groundbreaking AI-focused crypto, sets its sights on surpassing the achievements of Quant (QUANT) by the upcoming Bitcoin halving. 
InQubeta seeks to transform the fundraising and community engagement dynamics for AI startups. This platform’s goal is to build a transpare­nt and inclusive investment e­nvironment that promotes empowe­rment, growth, and achieveme­nt for AI technology startups. Some cryptocurrency expe­rts foresee tre­mendous potential after this proje­ct’s launch.
Let’s examine why Solana faces a $3 million investor outflow and why InQubeta hopes it can surpass Quant in the upcoming Bitcoin halving. 
InQubeta: revolutionizing crowdfunding with AI ad NFTs integration
InQubeta is a pioneering crowdfunding platform that connects AI and crypto effortlessly, presenting promising investment possibilities. This emerging crypto aims to surpass established projects like Quant because of its unique features and outstanding presale performance. The presale of this new DeFi project has been making waves in the market, heading towards $11 million. In the eighth stage, the presale has sold over 856 QUBE tokens and raised over $10.9 million. 
This emerging crypto project presents the community with another avenue to benefit from staking QUBE tokens. By staking their tokens, inve­stors can earn rewards, as a portion of the platform’s 5% sale­ tax goes toward a dedicated re­ward pool. This unique approach encourages participation among toke­n holders and aids the advanceme­nt of AI technology startups.
On InQubeta, investors have access to diverse investment options, each minted as a trending NFT and fractionalized. This method accommodates investors with different financial capacities, offering an accessible and adaptable investment journey. Early backing yields financial advantages and enables investors to play a pivotal role in advancing AI technology startups.
The InQubeta trending NFT marketplace functions as a link, facilitating the connection between AI startups and prospective investors. By creatively integrating NFTs and QUBE tokens, InQubeta has built a symbiotic ecosystem. This approach allows AI startups to secure vital funding while investors get the opportunity to participate in this innovative project and invest in AI.
Unlike Quant, this new DeFi project is driven by the vision of establishing an inclusive and democratic investment environment for its community participants. Utilizing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the organization delegated significant governance authority to its community. This feature empowers QUBE token holders to shape decisions regarding the QUBE protocol. Token holders can initiate proposals, foster discourse, and participate in voting processes for approval.

Solana: pioneering fast, secure, and scalable decentralized solutions
Solana is a blockchain platform providing rapid, secure, scalable decentralized applications and crypto-assets. The SOL cryptocurrency network recently experienced a 5-hour outage due to a bug triggering an infinite loop in cryptocurrency transactions.
CoinShares reports that Solana is the sole altcoin experiencing outflows in the past week, amounting to $3 million, nearly doubling from the preceding week. Such developments underscore the apprehensions among cryptocurrency investors. Despite these challenges, SOL possesses significant potential due to its hybrid technology, which combines proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS).
Quant: bridging distributed ledger networks with QRC-20 tokens and smart contracts
The Quant software allows e­xisting distributed ledger ne­tworks to interconnect. QUANT gives organizations and gove­rnments the foundation to connect their offerings across multiple blockchains, permitting e­ffective information exchange­ between syste­ms. This method empowers differe­nt programs to work jointly while keeping use­r data private and secure. 
Additionally, Quant enables deve­lopers to introduce their blockchain-ne­utral tokens using the QRC-20 token norm, e­quivalent to Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard for de­ploying compatible interchangeable­ tokens. The new pre­sentation of QRC-20 smart contracts brings a user-friendly, drag-and-drop style­ framework, making the arrangeme­nt of QRC-20 tokens on the QUANT less de­manding for associations, even without past expe­rience in this field. 
Conclusion
While Solana faces a $3 million investor outflow, InQubeta, an AI crypto, is aiming to surpass Quant by the next Bitcoin halving. 
With a firm commitme­nt to advancement, accessibility, and progre­ss driven by community involvement, InQube­ta serves as evide­nce for how new technologie­s can reshape finance and inve­stment through transformative power.

Can $100 in Bitgert Really Blossom Into $1M? Exploring the Possibilities,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-07 19:05:30.683897,"Early investors of Bitgert have seen a meteoric rise and the community has been bullish on this project for so long. 
Bitgert’s team is thrilled to witness a surge in user adoption on their Bitgert POA blockchain. 
More users are recognizing the benefits of their efficient and secure platform, leading to a growing community of enthusiasts and developers.
A 345% increase in trading volume over the past 7 days indicate a strong sign of a potential bull run for Bitgert.
Can Bitgert make you a millionaire? 
The live Bitgert price today is $0.0000002257 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,611,104 USD. Bitgert is up 3.12% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #465, with a live market cap of $89,507,293 USD. It has a circulating supply of 395,688,215,721,653 BRISE coins.




BRISE claims to have a real use case with becoming the global payment system and is applied as a peer-to-peer (P2P) service in the BRISE dApp Wallet. 
The optimization of block interval, block volume and consensus algorithm also help Bitgert reach a performance rate of up to 100,000 TPS. 
Bitgert BRC20 is the first zero gas fee blockchain and is also the most scalable chain in the industry. The gas fee for this chain is $0.00000001, and the transaction speed is 100K TPS. They claim to have alleviated the blockchain trilemma, which is decentralisation, security, and scalability. 
The team is constantly creating products that increase the adoption of crypto in the real world. With the cheaper and faster blockchain(BRC20 chain), they are about to launch Bitgert Paybrise, a product that enables merchants to accept $BRISE payments in the next few months.
The full supply of BRISE coins of 1,000,000,000,000,000 coins was minted at the platform
launch.
The distribution of Bitgert (BRISE) is as follows:

50.00% is allocated to Initial Burn
38.00% is allocated to Liquidity
7.00% is allocated to Future Development & Marketing
5.00% is allocated to Dev Team

Burning of this supply is necessary to bring the prices up.
This is where the project’s USP lies; its unique selling proposition lies in this aggressive buyback and burn program. With every transaction, a 5% tax is levied, used to buy back BRISE tokens from the market and subsequently burned. This reduces circulating supply, theoretically increasing the value of remaining tokens. 
The recent price surges indicate a bullish run investors are looking forward to.
Bitgert managed to be one of the better-performing cryptocurrencies at a time when the overall market went down by more than 60%.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Billionaire Mark Cuban Of Shark Tank Fame Says BTC Better Than Gold As New ICO Green Bitcoin Surges Towards $3 Mil...,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 19:05:33.109073,"The Bitcoin price rose by a fraction of a percentage in the last 24 hours to trade at $66,798 as of 03:31 a.m. EST on trading volume that dropped 44% to $56.16 billion.
This comes as billionaire Mark Cuban, known for his role in the reality TV show ”Shark Tank,” says that BTC is better than gold.
In an interview with CNBC, Cuban said that as an investment option he’d choose Bitcoin over gold ”all day, every day.”

Mark Cuban on CNBC: ""There’s only going to be 21 million #Bitcoin "".
Further said: ""The more people that buy and the fewer people that sell, means the price is going to go up and that's the nature of it, and it's a great store of value"".#Crypto #BitcoinETF #BTC… pic.twitter.com/BvDJqjKZzc

Cuban believes Bitcoin, with its finite supply of 21 million coins, is a superior store of value compared to gold’s potentially unlimited and unknown supply, making it a more appealing investment.

In 2022, Cuban expressed strong criticism towards gold investors, bluntly stating that they are ”dumb.” He argues that gold is an outdated investment choice and advocates for Bitcoin as the future of safe-haven investments.
Bitcoin Price Set To Break The Upper Boundary Of The Bullish Pennant


  BTCUSD Chart Analysis Source: Tradingview.com
 

Since the beginning of February, Bitcoin’s price has been on a steady rise, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $69,294. However, it subsequently retraced back to $59,000.
BTC’s resilience shines through as it stages a remarkable recovery, with bulls able to sustain the price within the confines of the bullish pennant.
BTC is trading above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), further evidence of the continued bullish sentiment. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 58, an indication that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. 
However, the RSI is moving to the north, which could be a sign of incoming intensified buying.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the sentiments of a looming bullish rally as it trades over the zero line. Moreover, the red bars on the histogram seem to diminish towards the neutral line, a confirmation of a rebound to the upside.
The Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (green) is trading over the trigger line (orange), representing a bullish moving average crossover, which is an encouragement for investors to buy more, as there is an impending bull rally.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
The Bitcoin price analysis shows that BTC is currently on a bullish move as it recovers towards its set ATH of $69,294. The bulls are aiming to breach the upper boundary of the bullish pennant, supported by the golden cross at $42,875 to drive the price up, aiming at $75,000.
In case the bears take charge of the price at these levels, support levels at $61,562 and $59,380 would offer stabilization points in the event of a retracement.
As the Bitcoin price steadies after a rollercoaster week, some investors are diversifying into new ICO Green Bitcoin, which crypto analyst Jacob Bury says has the potential to surge 10X on launch.

Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet shows an increase from 9,720 BTC as reported in its last earnings report, to 11,509 BTC.
Reports from Arkham Intelligence suggest that Tesla Incorporation has acquired 1,000 Bitcoins since their last acquisition of BTC in 2021. However, Musk and Tesla have yet to comment on these speculations, as per Arkham Intelligence’s report. 
Previously, Tesla surged its Bitcoin holdings in January 2021 with a purchase of $1.5 billion. Tesla reportedly held 9,720 BTC in 2023. 
Tesla’s previous sale of BTC coincided with Bitcoin’s market movements. 
Looking into the current situation, the crypto community is curious about Musk’s renewed interest in Bitcoin. Additionally, Elon Musk’s involvement in cryptocurrency extends to SpaceX, holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet.
Tesla’s Stock Decline Amidst Chinese EV Market Challenges
While in the U.S. we are seeing Tesla and SpaceX increasing their Bitcoin/crypto holdings, in the absolute east, Tesla is facing challenges.
In the Chinese EV market, Tesla has witnessed a more than 7% drop in its stock. Weak shipments from its Shanghai factory, with a 19% YoY decline in deliveries, indicate intensified competition and disruptions tied to the Lunar New Year holidays.

Hashing It Out: Will 2024 be the best year for DeFi yet?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 19:05:58.085349,"In the 50th episode of the Hashing It Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw speaks with Sonali Giovino, global head of ecosystems at De.Fi, about the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As the crypto space sees signs of a potential bull run, Giovino breaks down the power of DeFi, the problems associated with the sector, and how they could impact mass adoption in the coming years.
Giovino believes the groundwork has been laid for exponential growth in the decentralized finance world as the market turns green. However, she also explains that now is the most important time to consider the various risks that cut across the DeFi sector, from security to regulations.


Giovino explains that security has always been the biggest risk, with many smart contract vulnerabilities having led to major losses over the years. She adds that until recently, there was not enough attention given to DeFi security issues. This is changing as more developers work with auditors, more companies build security tools for users, and more events focus on DeFi security.
Despite the risks, Giovino says people are encouraged to venture into DeFi because it is empowering:

 “I think sometimes people are concerned about getting into the DeFi space because of the crypto scams or, you know, the volatility and the risk. But one of the things I have to encourage and really enlighten is that DeFi is not only disruptive, but it’s extremely empowering. It empowers people around the world to create solutions and to tackle some of these issues that, of course, affect everybody.”

Crypto Markets Anticipate Major Updates as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Approaches,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 19:06:01.487283,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Crypto Markets Anticipate Major Updates as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Approaches
In a crucial week for cryptocurrency investors, eyes are set on the impending Ethereum Dencun upgrade, expected to significantly impact the market. This layer2 scaling solution is poised to slash transaction fees and enhance network capacity, potentially fostering growth in total value locked and user activity. This expansion could, in turn, lift the value of associated tokens.
Ethereum’s Dencun: A Game Changer for Transaction Costs
Ethereum’s network is set to adopt the Dencun hard fork, a much-anticipated layer2 scaling solution, which is predicted to transform the blockchain’s transaction efficiency. By reducing fees and accommodating more network activities, the upgrade could accelerate the growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem, thereby boosting token prices.
Implications for Layer2 Protocols and Altcoins
David Silverman of Polygon Labs has indicated that the effects of the upgrade on layer2 protocols will be observable by the end of March. As these protocols implement the update, altcoins such as MATIC could see substantial benefits and potentially outperform in the market.
The Dencun hard fork is composed of nine improvement proposals and marks a significant evolution in the Ethereum infrastructure with a nod to a multi-chain future. Silverman highlights Ethereum’s commitment to rollup-centric solutions, aiming to decentralize scaling responsibilities and enhance user experiences.
As the cryptocurrency space watches the Ethereum upgrade, layer2 solutions like Arbitrum, Starknet, Polygon, and OP Token are among the altcoins that could experience a positive impact. With the integration of these updates, they are positioned for a potential rise by month-end.

XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, has seen a spectacular increase in adoption and distribution, with over five million accounts currently holding 59.8 billion XRP, according to the most recent data from Xrpl Services, an XRP Ledger explorer.
According to data from the Xrpl services platform, there are 5,089,197 XRP accounts. The number of accounts with zero balances is 1,592. This means that 59,879,274,264 XRP are held in roughly five million accounts, demonstrating increased demand and interest in the digital asset.
In 2023, a U.S. judge determined that XRP is not a security in and of itself, giving the cryptocurrency regulatory certainty.
The sixth-largest cryptocurrency has also benefited from the overall bullish sentiment and momentum on the crypto market, which has seen the total market cap surpass $2 trillion and the Bitcoin price reach all-time highs of over $69,000.
Even though the XRP price has relatively underperformed in comparison to other altcoins, the data revealing the number of accounts and total XRP holdings might reveal resilience on the part of XRP holders.
XRP continues to benefit from rising interest and demand from institutional investors, who have flocked to the crypto space in pursuit of alternative and innovative assets, triggering $2.5 million in inflows in the past week, per the latest CoinShares report.
XRP price action
At the time of writing, XRP had risen 4.26% in the previous 24 hours to $0.628 in its second day of recovery following its sharp plunge on March 5. XRP hit intraday highs of $0.63, with the next goal of $0.67.
XRP fell from $0.67 on March 5, signaling that bears are vigorously defending the price.
The bears will once again attempt to defend the $0.67 level. If they do so, it will signal range-bound action shortly. XRP may fluctuate between the 50-day SMA and $0.67 for a little while.
The price recovered from the 50-day SMA of $0.547, indicating that bulls continue to buy on strong falls. XRP might make one more try to overcome the overhead barrier at $0.67 and begin its rise to $0.74.","['BTC', 'MM', 'EPIC', 'XRP', 'BILL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e33ec4f0aa6ee7ac2b62/
Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX Bitcoin Holdings Uncovered: Data,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 19:06:12.593337,"

  Cover image via U.Today


In a shocking revelation for the crypto industry, data from the blockchain analysis platform Arkham revealed the magnitude of Bitcoin (BTC) owned by Elon Musk's firms Tesla and SpaceX. 
Tesla's and SpaceX's Bitcoin holdings
According to a recent post on X, Arkham unveiled that Tesla currently holds 11,510 BTC, valued at approximately $780 million, distributed across 68 addresses.
Additionally, the data also shows that SpaceX boasts its own Bitcoin treasure chest, with holdings totaling 8,290 BTC, valued at approximately $560 million, dispersed across 28 addresses.
What makes this revelation even more surprising is that it contradicts Tesla's earlier disclosure in its Q4 report, where it claimed to possess 9,720 BTC. Arkham's findings suggest that Tesla's Bitcoin holdings have exceeded the previously reported figure, implying a potentially larger investment in the cryptocurrency than previously disclosed.
Tesla's journey into the world of Bitcoin began in February 2021 when the company made headlines by investing a substantial $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. This action sent ripples through the crypto space, catapulting Bitcoin's value to new highs. 
However, Arkham noted in its recent report that Tesla divested a portion of its holdings, selling $272 million worth of Bitcoin in Q1, 2021, and $936 million in Q2, 2022. Interestingly, Arkham's Tesla Intel Exchange Bounty uncovered a Tesla car purchase linked to the larger cluster of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings, providing additional validation for the platform's findings.
Musk's stance on cryptocurrency
Despite his endorsement of Bitcoin, Elon Musk remains somewhat hesitant toward cryptocurrency as a whole. When questioned about its impact on the monetary system by Cathie Wood, Musk admitted to spending little time pondering cryptocurrency but expressed a keen interest in understanding the nature of money itself. 
Notably, Musk has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin, often referring to it as the ""people's money"" and endorsing it through various means, including social media.","['28', 'BTC', 'ARKM', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e33ec4f0aa6ee7ac2b64/
Reviving Retail Interest Propels Bitcoin Trading to Yearly Peak,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 19:06:15.271354,"Key Points

Bitcoin’s spot trading volume recorded a yearly high of $46.26 billion on March 5, indicating increased retail investor interest.
The number of Bitcoin addresses with a minimum of $10 worth reached a new all-time high, further suggesting increased retail investor participation.

Bitcoin’s spot trading volume on centralized exchanges hit a yearly high on March 5, with a combined daily volume of $46.26 billion. This suggests an influx of retail investors purchasing the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.
Spot Trading Volume High
The volume of Bitcoin spot trading cooled slightly to $31.32 billion the following day. Binance accounted for over 74% or $18 billion of this total.
According to Mallika Kollar, a quantitative research associate at Bitwise, spot trading volume has surged nearly 680% since the beginning of the year, indicating a significant uptick in Bitcoin purchases.
Record Trading Volumes and Prices
The record trading volume coincided with a new all-time high in daily inflows for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ten U.S. Bitcoin ETFs set a record of $10 billion in daily trading volume on March 5, surpassing the previous week’s record of $7.7 billion.
These remarkable figures propelled Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high of over $69,200 on March 5. As of 1:30 pm (UTC), Bitcoin was trading at $66,878, reflecting a 1.09% increase in the preceding 24 hours.
In South Korea, Bitcoin’s price surged to as high as $72,000 on Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This price difference, known as the Kimchi Premium or Korea Premium Index, has been trending upward alongside Bitcoin’s price since early February.
The number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least $10 worth of the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of over 35 million on March 6. This further indicates increased retail investor participation. Similarly, online search trends for Bitcoin remain high, with worldwide searches averaging 80 between March 3 and March 9, a 31% increase from the previous year.
The number of Bitcoin transfers to Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange, is also on the rise, indicating that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking at the current price levels. However, it’s important to note that previous spikes have not only occurred during bull market tops, as seen in 2016-17.","['BTC', 'SPOT']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e340e0f8a513810944ea/
Next Stop for Cryptocurrencies: Where Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Heading?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 19:06:17.229000,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Next Stop for Cryptocurrencies: Where Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Heading?
Cryptocurrency investors are facing an extremely important week, which includes some of the most significant days of March. Alongside upcoming macroeconomic data, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will serve as a pivotal milestone. So why is Dencun important, and which altcoins, besides Ether, will benefit from it?
What is Ethereum Dencun?
Ethereum will celebrate the Dencun hard fork, a layer2 scaling solution, when it reaches the mainnet. The reason is clear: transaction costs will significantly decrease, and network activities will greatly expand. This means a rapid growth in the Total Value Locked (TVL) and active user charts. Indirectly, this will also help to increase token prices.

David Silverman, Vice President of Product at Polygon Labs, said that the latest update will start to be implemented by layer2 protocols within weeks. That means we will begin to see the results clearly by the end of March, starting from the 13th. As a result, many altcoins, including MATIC Coin, will have the opportunity to positively diverge during this process.

“In about a month and a half or two, every L2 that wants to use the blob space as a rollup will transition, and then users will see all the benefits.”

The Dencun hard fork includes nine different improvement proposals and is named Dencun as a combination of Ethereum’s execution layer upgrade Cancun and the consensus layer upgrade Deneb.
Layer2 Altcoins Set to Rise
The multi-chain future tells us a lot about today’s world, where Layer2 solutions cluster around Ethereum. David Silverman states that with the latest update, Ethereum has now clearly embraced this concept.

“This is an Ethereum roadmap item that says the future is really in rollups, as opposed to the base network being responsible for scaling. We will make changes to make them cheaper and more attractive for users and to become the standard carrier for Ethereum.”

The following altcoins are the most popular Ethereum l2 solutions and could benefit positively from the process by the end of March;

Arbitrum (ARB)
Starknet (STRK)
Polygon (MATIC)
OP Token

And there are many more cryptocurrencies.

Worldcoin refutes AEPD claims concerning Spanish ban,COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.news,2024-03-07 19:06:20.660270,"Worldcoin Data Protection Officer Jannick Preiwisch has countered the Spanish Data Protection Agency’s claims concerning the project’s ban in Spain.
On Mar. 6, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) ordered Worldcoin (WLD) to cease data collection and processing for up to three months due to complaints regarding insufficient information, data collection from minors, and the inability to withdraw consent.
Worldcoin, a digital ID cryptocurrency venture created by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has been temporarily banned in Spain due to concerns over how the company’s eyeball-scanning technology collected and processed biometric data.
Worldcoin’s World ID necessitates users to scan their irises using orbs. The device captures an image of the irises before users obtain a unique form of identification and the Worldcoin cryptocurrency. 
However, the AEPD has instructed Tools for Humanity, the company responsible for collecting and processing user data, to halt the collection of additional data for new users in the country and cease using the data already gathered by Worldcoin.
The agency emphasized that processing biometric data demands “special protection” due to the “high risks to the rights of individuals,” which include potential data transfers to third parties.
Earlier today, Preiwisch, the Data Protection Officer at the Worldcoin Foundation, emailed crypto.news that the company is eager to dispel any false claims made by the AEPD. 

“It is unfortunate that the Spanish data protection authority (AEPD) is circumventing established procedures under GDPR with their actions today, which are limited to Spain and not the broader EU. Additionally, It is also unfortunate that they are spreading inaccurate and misleading claims about our technology globally after our efforts to provide them with an accurate view of Worldcoin and World ID have gone unanswered for months. We are grateful to now have the opportunity to help the AEPD better understand the important facts regarding this essential and lawful technology.” Jannick Preiwisch, Data Protection Officer, Worldcoin Foundation

In recent weeks, privacy experts have criticized Worldcoin, expressing concerns that the company may utilize the collected information for purposes such as personalized marketing.
The ban in Spain mirrors a similar suspension in Kenya, where the local data protection authority banned Worldcoin’s processing activities, and the government mandated the suspension of eye scans. Worldcoin has also encountered technical issues since its launch, with some users reporting difficulties in claiming tokens after undergoing eye scans.

Worldcoin’s technical and regulatory hurdles 
Worldcoin has faced a series of controversies and challenges that have drawn attention from both users and regulators.
MIT Technology Review investigations have uncovered troubling findings about Worldcoin’s marketing practices. Allegations of deceptive marketing, excessive data collection beyond disclosed limits, and inadequate informed consent procedures have raised concerns about the project’s transparency and user privacy protections.
Additionally, Worldcoin faced scrutiny over its handling of Sybil attacks, a security threat where a single entity creates and controls multiple fake accounts within a network. Questions have been raised about the project’s approach to preventing such attacks, especially in decentralized networks where maintaining pseudonymity is crucial for trust.
On Jan. 31, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) in Hong Kong announced that it had executed raids on six premises associated with Worldcoin in the city to gather documents and information about Worldcoin’s operations. 
These developments highlight the multifaceted challenges Worldcoin faces as it grapples with controversies surrounding privacy, marketing ethics, security vulnerabilities, and market fluctuations.
WLD is trading at $7.20 when writing, representing an 8% price rise in the last 24 hours.

The Arizona State Senate passed a resolution to encourage state pensions to consider adding spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and other digital asset ETFs into their investment portfolios.
The resolution urges the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) and the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) to consider the implications of adding digital asset ETFs to their investment mix.
It also asks them to closely monitor developments in Bitcoin ETFs and other digital asset ETFs and to consult with the fund management firms that manage such investment vehicles.
It then wants them to submit a comprehensive report on the feasibility, risk and potential benefits of directing a portion of state retirement system monies into digital asset ETFs.

The Solana network recently encountered a significant setback, enduring a 5-hour outage that precipitated a staggering $3 million exodus of investors. The outage was attributed to a bug, triggering an infinite loop within cryptocurrency transactions. Concurrently, InQubeta (QUBE), a groundbreaking AI-focused crypto, sets its sights on surpassing the achievements of Quant (QUANT) by the upcoming Bitcoin halving. 
InQubeta seeks to transform the fundraising and community engagement dynamics for AI startups. This platform’s goal is to build a transpare­nt and inclusive investment e­nvironment that promotes empowe­rment, growth, and achieveme­nt for AI technology startups. Some cryptocurrency expe­rts foresee tre­mendous potential after this proje­ct’s launch.
Let’s examine why Solana faces a $3 million investor outflow and why InQubeta hopes it can surpass Quant in the upcoming Bitcoin halving. 
InQubeta: revolutionizing crowdfunding with AI ad NFTs integration
InQubeta is a pioneering crowdfunding platform that connects AI and crypto effortlessly, presenting promising investment possibilities. This emerging crypto aims to surpass established projects like Quant because of its unique features and outstanding presale performance. The presale of this new DeFi project has been making waves in the market, heading towards $11 million. In the eighth stage, the presale has sold over 856 QUBE tokens and raised over $10.9 million. 
This emerging crypto project presents the community with another avenue to benefit from staking QUBE tokens. By staking their tokens, inve­stors can earn rewards, as a portion of the platform’s 5% sale­ tax goes toward a dedicated re­ward pool. This unique approach encourages participation among toke­n holders and aids the advanceme­nt of AI technology startups.
On InQubeta, investors have access to diverse investment options, each minted as a trending NFT and fractionalized. This method accommodates investors with different financial capacities, offering an accessible and adaptable investment journey. Early backing yields financial advantages and enables investors to play a pivotal role in advancing AI technology startups.
The InQubeta trending NFT marketplace functions as a link, facilitating the connection between AI startups and prospective investors. By creatively integrating NFTs and QUBE tokens, InQubeta has built a symbiotic ecosystem. This approach allows AI startups to secure vital funding while investors get the opportunity to participate in this innovative project and invest in AI.
Unlike Quant, this new DeFi project is driven by the vision of establishing an inclusive and democratic investment environment for its community participants. Utilizing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the organization delegated significant governance authority to its community. This feature empowers QUBE token holders to shape decisions regarding the QUBE protocol. Token holders can initiate proposals, foster discourse, and participate in voting processes for approval.

Solana: pioneering fast, secure, and scalable decentralized solutions
Solana is a blockchain platform providing rapid, secure, scalable decentralized applications and crypto-assets. The SOL cryptocurrency network recently experienced a 5-hour outage due to a bug triggering an infinite loop in cryptocurrency transactions.
CoinShares reports that Solana is the sole altcoin experiencing outflows in the past week, amounting to $3 million, nearly doubling from the preceding week. Such developments underscore the apprehensions among cryptocurrency investors. Despite these challenges, SOL possesses significant potential due to its hybrid technology, which combines proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS).
Quant: bridging distributed ledger networks with QRC-20 tokens and smart contracts
The Quant software allows e­xisting distributed ledger ne­tworks to interconnect. QUANT gives organizations and gove­rnments the foundation to connect their offerings across multiple blockchains, permitting e­ffective information exchange­ between syste­ms. This method empowers differe­nt programs to work jointly while keeping use­r data private and secure. 
Additionally, Quant enables deve­lopers to introduce their blockchain-ne­utral tokens using the QRC-20 token norm, e­quivalent to Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard for de­ploying compatible interchangeable­ tokens. The new pre­sentation of QRC-20 smart contracts brings a user-friendly, drag-and-drop style­ framework, making the arrangeme­nt of QRC-20 tokens on the QUANT less de­manding for associations, even without past expe­rience in this field. 
Conclusion
While Solana faces a $3 million investor outflow, InQubeta, an AI crypto, is aiming to surpass Quant by the next Bitcoin halving. 
With a firm commitme­nt to advancement, accessibility, and progre­ss driven by community involvement, InQube­ta serves as evide­nce for how new technologie­s can reshape finance and inve­stment through transformative power.

Can $100 in Bitgert Really Blossom Into $1M? Exploring the Possibilities,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-07 19:06:30.078044,"Early investors of Bitgert have seen a meteoric rise and the community has been bullish on this project for so long. 
Bitgert’s team is thrilled to witness a surge in user adoption on their Bitgert POA blockchain. 
More users are recognizing the benefits of their efficient and secure platform, leading to a growing community of enthusiasts and developers.
A 345% increase in trading volume over the past 7 days indicate a strong sign of a potential bull run for Bitgert.
Can Bitgert make you a millionaire? 
The live Bitgert price today is $0.0000002257 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,611,104 USD. Bitgert is up 3.12% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #465, with a live market cap of $89,507,293 USD. It has a circulating supply of 395,688,215,721,653 BRISE coins.




BRISE claims to have a real use case with becoming the global payment system and is applied as a peer-to-peer (P2P) service in the BRISE dApp Wallet. 
The optimization of block interval, block volume and consensus algorithm also help Bitgert reach a performance rate of up to 100,000 TPS. 
Bitgert BRC20 is the first zero gas fee blockchain and is also the most scalable chain in the industry. The gas fee for this chain is $0.00000001, and the transaction speed is 100K TPS. They claim to have alleviated the blockchain trilemma, which is decentralisation, security, and scalability. 
The team is constantly creating products that increase the adoption of crypto in the real world. With the cheaper and faster blockchain(BRC20 chain), they are about to launch Bitgert Paybrise, a product that enables merchants to accept $BRISE payments in the next few months.
The full supply of BRISE coins of 1,000,000,000,000,000 coins was minted at the platform
launch.
The distribution of Bitgert (BRISE) is as follows:

50.00% is allocated to Initial Burn
38.00% is allocated to Liquidity
7.00% is allocated to Future Development & Marketing
5.00% is allocated to Dev Team

Burning of this supply is necessary to bring the prices up.
This is where the project’s USP lies; its unique selling proposition lies in this aggressive buyback and burn program. With every transaction, a 5% tax is levied, used to buy back BRISE tokens from the market and subsequently burned. This reduces circulating supply, theoretically increasing the value of remaining tokens. 
The recent price surges indicate a bullish run investors are looking forward to.
Bitgert managed to be one of the better-performing cryptocurrencies at a time when the overall market went down by more than 60%.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Billionaire Mark Cuban Of Shark Tank Fame Says BTC Better Than Gold As New ICO Green Bitcoin Surges Towards $3 Mil...,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Inside Bitcoins,2024-03-07 19:06:33.325340,"The Bitcoin price rose by a fraction of a percentage in the last 24 hours to trade at $66,798 as of 03:31 a.m. EST on trading volume that dropped 44% to $56.16 billion.
This comes as billionaire Mark Cuban, known for his role in the reality TV show ”Shark Tank,” says that BTC is better than gold.
In an interview with CNBC, Cuban said that as an investment option he’d choose Bitcoin over gold ”all day, every day.”

Mark Cuban on CNBC: ""There’s only going to be 21 million #Bitcoin "".
Further said: ""The more people that buy and the fewer people that sell, means the price is going to go up and that's the nature of it, and it's a great store of value"".#Crypto #BitcoinETF #BTC… pic.twitter.com/BvDJqjKZzc

Cuban believes Bitcoin, with its finite supply of 21 million coins, is a superior store of value compared to gold’s potentially unlimited and unknown supply, making it a more appealing investment.

In 2022, Cuban expressed strong criticism towards gold investors, bluntly stating that they are ”dumb.” He argues that gold is an outdated investment choice and advocates for Bitcoin as the future of safe-haven investments.
Bitcoin Price Set To Break The Upper Boundary Of The Bullish Pennant


  BTCUSD Chart Analysis Source: Tradingview.com
 

Since the beginning of February, Bitcoin’s price has been on a steady rise, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $69,294. However, it subsequently retraced back to $59,000.
BTC’s resilience shines through as it stages a remarkable recovery, with bulls able to sustain the price within the confines of the bullish pennant.
BTC is trading above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), further evidence of the continued bullish sentiment. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 58, an indication that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. 
However, the RSI is moving to the north, which could be a sign of incoming intensified buying.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the sentiments of a looming bullish rally as it trades over the zero line. Moreover, the red bars on the histogram seem to diminish towards the neutral line, a confirmation of a rebound to the upside.
The Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (green) is trading over the trigger line (orange), representing a bullish moving average crossover, which is an encouragement for investors to buy more, as there is an impending bull rally.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
The Bitcoin price analysis shows that BTC is currently on a bullish move as it recovers towards its set ATH of $69,294. The bulls are aiming to breach the upper boundary of the bullish pennant, supported by the golden cross at $42,875 to drive the price up, aiming at $75,000.
In case the bears take charge of the price at these levels, support levels at $61,562 and $59,380 would offer stabilization points in the event of a retracement.
As the Bitcoin price steadies after a rollercoaster week, some investors are diversifying into new ICO Green Bitcoin, which crypto analyst Jacob Bury says has the potential to surge 10X on launch.

Did Elon Musk Buy More Bitcoins? Here’s What Data Reveals,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-07 19:06:35.051790,"The post Did Elon Musk Buy More Bitcoins? Here’s What Data Reveals appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Tesla’s Bitcoin wallet shows an increase from 9,720 BTC as reported in its last earnings report, to 11,509 BTC.
Reports from Arkham Intelligence suggest that Tesla Incorporation has acquired 1,000 Bitcoins since their last acquisition of BTC in 2021. However, Musk and Tesla have yet to comment on these speculations, as per Arkham Intelligence’s report. 
Previously, Tesla surged its Bitcoin holdings in January 2021 with a purchase of $1.5 billion. Tesla reportedly held 9,720 BTC in 2023. 
Tesla’s previous sale of BTC coincided with Bitcoin’s market movements. 
Looking into the current situation, the crypto community is curious about Musk’s renewed interest in Bitcoin. Additionally, Elon Musk’s involvement in cryptocurrency extends to SpaceX, holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet.
Tesla’s Stock Decline Amidst Chinese EV Market Challenges
While in the U.S. we are seeing Tesla and SpaceX increasing their Bitcoin/crypto holdings, in the absolute east, Tesla is facing challenges.
In the Chinese EV market, Tesla has witnessed a more than 7% drop in its stock. Weak shipments from its Shanghai factory, with a 19% YoY decline in deliveries, indicate intensified competition and disruptions tied to the Lunar New Year holidays.

Bitcoin Price Fluctuations 
Ever since Nov 2021, Bitcoin has once again reached its new all-time-high breaching the $69000 mark slightly. The Bitcoin price surge this week is believed to be driven by capital inflows ever since the ETF approvals, and its correlation with technology stocks. 
CoinShares data indicates consistent capital inflows into Bitcoin-linked investment products. The imminent halving in Bitcoin production adds anticipation to market dynamics.
Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings and market activities show Musk showing a renewed interest in accumulating Bitcoin after it seems his much-loved dogecoin has failed to reach $1. All these developments taking place together represent the interconnectedness of Tesla’s stock performance, Bitcoin fluctuations, and broader market trends.","['LUNAR', 'BTC', 'ARKM', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9e0f5e0f8a513810944e0/

Bitcoin spot trading volume reached a yearly high
Following the yearly high, Bitcoin spot trading volume cooled to $31.32 billion on March 6, with Binance accounting for over 74%, or $18 billion, of the daily spot Bitcoin trading volume.
“People are buying Bitcoin. Spot trading volume has shot up almost 680% since the start of the year,” according to a March 6 X (formerly Twitter) post by Mallika Kollar, quantitative research associate at Bitwise.

The year-to-date record trading volume coincided with a new all-time high in daily inflows for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ten U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs set a record $10 billion in daily trading volume on March 5, beating last week's $7.7 billion record.
“These are bananas numbers for ETFs under [two months] old,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a March 5 X post reporting the figures.
The soaring volumes across exchanges and ETFs propelled Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of above $69,200 on March 5. Bitcoin was up 1.09% in the 24 hours leading up to 1:30 pm (UTC) to change hands at $66,878, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Retail interest appears to also be surging in South Korea, where Bitcoin went as high as $72,000 (based on the KRW/USD exchange rate) on March 5 on Upbit, the country’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. This price difference is known as the Kimchi Premium or Korea Premium Index — and it has been in an uptrend along with BTC price since early February.
Related: Bitcoin just had its best day ever — Is $100K BTC price programmed? 
Since South Korea has no approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, retail spot buying is likely the main driver of the premium. 
Number of BTC addresses worth over $10 at new highs
The number of addresses with at least $10 worth of Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over 35 million on March 6, according to Coinglass data, suggesting increased retail investor participation.

Mirroring the growing retail interest, online search trends for Bitcoin remain elevated. Bitcoin searches worldwide averaged 80 between March 3 and March 9, up over 31% from 61 a year ago when the price was around $20,000, according to Google Trends data.

BlockFi And FTX Finalize Debt Settlement Of $874.5 Million,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 18:06:48.379250,"The long-run legal battle between bankrupt cryptocurrency firms BlockFi and FTX reached a debt settlement for $874.5 Million.
On March 6, FTX, Almeda Research, and BlockFi struck a deal after a long series of lawsuits. BlockFi will receive around $874.5 Million in claims against cryptocurrency firms. All three firms had a complicated and intertwined relationship. However, the debt settlement emerged as a full recovery for customers.
FTX settles with BlockFi
As stated in a court filing on March 6, BlockFi and FTX have settled their conflicts as FTX agreed to pay up to $874.5 Million to BlockFi. The terms and conditions are contingent upon acceptance by Judge John Dorsey from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.

If fulfilled, BlockFi’s claims against FTX will be resolved. As per the settlement, around $185.2 Million is assigned to a claim against FTX whereas $689.3 Million is to a claim against Alameda Research for received loans. 
Additionally, around $250 Million will be secured for BlockFi, and the rest of the amount will be used to pay customers and other creditors. However, the judge still needs to sign off on the agreement.
Kenneth Aulet, partner at Brown Rudnick reacted to the situation.
“It’s an excellent outcome for BlockFi’s customers and creditors”, said Aulet. 
In November 2022, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11, indicating FTX’s failure as one of the main reasons behind the bankruptcy. 
The debt settlement is a major step for both parties as it will help in mitigating losses for both firms. FTX had offered BlockFi $400 Million via its legal name West Realm Shires Services and positioned itself as one of the biggest creditors of BlockFi with a $275 Million claim. In addition, the platform claimed FTX owed it over $1 Billion. 
Moreover, BlockFi has to pay over $10 Billion to approximately 100K creditors which involves $1 Billion to the three biggest creditors and $220 Million to Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Ankura Trust Company is one of the largest creditors of BlockFi. 
BlockFi’s withdrawal plan
In October 2023, BlockFi emerged from bankruptcy and shared a withdrawal plan to return its assets to the customers and showcase a significant milestone in its financial recovery. As per the plan, customers can submit withdrawal requests and withdrawals will be available to all its wallet customers. 
December 31, 2023, was the last date finalized by the BlockFi platform for the wallet withdrawal request. Meanwhile, the loan customers and lender’s BIA will have to wait for 2024. Furthermore, other distributions will depend on the progress of the asset recovery plan.
Additionally, Michael Kaplan, US Bankruptcy Court Judge resolved and approved a settlement between BlocFi and 3AC. 
FTX was one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges introduced in May 2019 by Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, and other former employees of Jane Street. The platform collapsed in November 2022.
BlockFi was a cryptocurrency lender introduced in 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez. In November 2022, the platform filed for bankruptcy soon after FTX.","['JANE', 'MM', 'REALM', 'BILL']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9de8035539f471eb408b7/

Shiba Inu Signals Breakdown at This Support Level,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheNewsCrypto,2024-03-07 18:06:52.873633,"
Shiba Inu displayed a 15% decline over the last 24 hours, dropping to $0.00003126.
The daily trading volume of SHIB experienced a 63% decrease in a day.

The leading memecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is currently facing a tricky situation as its price hints at a potential downturn. While the major cryptocurrencies are experiencing a slight decline, SHIB’s recent performance suggests a significant challenge ahead.
Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has witnessed a decline of over 25%, bringing its price from $0.00003708 to $0.00002944. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00003207 with a market cap of $4.5 billion. This drop in SHIB’s price was accompanied by a substantial decrease in trading volume, which has fallen by 63% to $4.8 billion. Such a sharp decrease in both price and trading activity indicates a possible loss of investor confidence or a buildup to a significant sell-off.




Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Chart (Source: TradingView))



The future of Shiba Inu’s price depends on its ability to maintain crucial support levels. If the price dips below the key support level of $0.000025, which triggered its recent peak gains, it could signify the end of the current bull rally and potentially trigger a bear market sentiment for SHIB.
However, if SHIB manages to reclaim strength and recover, it may aim for immediate resistance at $0.000035. A successful breach of this level could pave the way for further rallies, potentially propelling the price towards $0.000038 and even $0.000045.","['SHIBA', 'SHIB']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9dd56c4f0aa6ee7ac2b51/

Filecoin (FIL) Cools off While Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) Emerges as the Hottest Memecoin To Watch,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheCoinrise Media,2024-03-07 18:06:55.130096,"TLDR 

Analysts are positive that the new update could spur Filecoin (FIL) to $12.11.
Following the conclusion of Rebel Satoshi’s ($RBLZ) blockchain ICO, it has been listed on reputable DEXs and is set to continue its upward trajectory.

Lately, Filecoin has experienced fluctuations between bullish and bearish trends, with optimistic forecasts prevailing among the best DeFi experts. Meanwhile, investors in Rebel Satoshi, another compelling project in the cryptocurrency realm, are bullish after an impressive presale. $RBLZ has now been listed and holds great promise for investors this year. Let’s explore the latest around FIL and $RBLZ.
Filecoin Price Prediction: New Partnership Could Spur a Significant Surge for FIL
On February 27, the Inter Planetary Consensus (IPC) and Fluence unveiled plans for the launch of the Fluence Network, powered by IPC. This decentralized serverless computing platform promises cost-effective, verifiable, and genuinely decentralized computing solutions for web3 developers. This partnership amplifies Fluence’s mission to create an open and auditable computing platform for the growing cloudless economy on Filecoin.
Following this news, the value of FIL has experienced a significant rise. On February 27, FIL traded at $7.659, but it increased to $9.319 on March 2, marking a 21.67% rise in Filecoin’s value. Consequently, some market analysts foresee an uptrend for Filecoin because of its new collaborations and partnerships. Thus, they expect FIL to rise to $12.110 by the end of April.
On the flip side, some FIL experts are bearish about Filecoin’s near future because of recent signals from technical indicators. Hence, they forecast that FIL could drop to $7.980 by mid-March. With this mixed forecast, analysts believe considering Rebel Satoshi could be a good option. Let’s see why.

Rebel Satoshi’s Presale Takes the Headline Amidst a Bullish Market
Rebel Satoshi is a meme coin project that seeks to improve financial industry decentralization. Therefore, it is not surprising that investors are drawn to the project given its admirable goal. Crypto pundits have also praised Rebel Satoshi for its community-driven strategy against centralization, leading savvy investors to consider $RBLZ among the top altcoins for investment. 
$RBLZ adopters play a crucial role in the Rebel Satoshi community, contributing significantly to its vibrant ecosystem. Additionally, $RBLZ holders enjoy exclusive access to 9,999 rare and trending NFTs and can earn fantastic rewards by completing interactive tasks.
These attractive offerings caused the $RBLZ token presale to enjoy remarkable attention and patronage. Rebel Satoshi’s presale saw $RBLZ surge from $0.010 in the initial presale stage to $0.025 by the end of its final presale stage on February 29.
Experts recognize Rebel Satoshi’s potential to outshine competitors and dominate the market, making it a wise choice to diversify holdings with $RBLZ. $RBLZ has already been launched on Coinstore and Uniswap at a listing price of $0.025. Thus, many analysts advise investors to invest in Rebel Satoshi now because of its prospects.

Lava Introduces Innovative Solutions for Decentralized Finance Market,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 18:06:57.982622,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Lava Introduces Innovative Solutions for Decentralized Finance Market
 The blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape is continuously witnessing growth with new advancements. The decentralized lending platform Lava has officially announced that it will begin operations on March 7th. Lava aims to mitigate the issue of impermanent loss for liquidity providers by leveraging automatic market makers (AMMs), thus enhancing liquidity management across various blockchain ecosystems. 
Industry Expert Weighs In on Decentralized Exchanges
 John Lo, the crypto asset managing partner at Recharge Capital, has identified impermanent loss as a significant challenge for liquidity providers on decentralized exchanges. He emphasizes that this not only inconveniences users but also encourages a shift back to traditional financial systems and obstructs the development of efficient on-chain markets. 
 Impermanent loss, a major concern in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, arises when there is a price fluctuation of a token after it has been deposited into a liquidity pool for yield farming. This issue often deters institutional investors from the DeFi space. Lo, however, believes that Lava’s initiative to minimize such losses may forge a new direction for DeFi applications, offering a competitive edge over centralized counterparts. 
Lava’s Positioning in the DeFi Space
 Backed by Recharge Capital, Lava’s freshly launched platform is designed to bolster the position of liquidity providers and enhance market depth for cryptocurrencies. The platform is setting out to address impermanent loss by balancing market maker rates and providing liquidity through a collateralization and lending model. Lava aspires to streamline yield optimization for passive liquidity contributors, while also bridging the gap between DeFi and centralized finance protocols, enabling users to discover efficient market rates. 
 Initially, Lava will be accessible within the Arbitrum and Base blockchain infrastructures, with plans to extend its offerings to additional blockchain networks in the future. This multi-chain approach reflects Lava’s commitment to broadening its impact within the DeFi ecosystem.

 A significant development has emerged within the cryptocurrency market, as a Greek exchange contemplates integrating a novel blockchain-based funding mechanism. This system, known as the electronic book building (EBB), is set to be established under the collaboration of the Athens Stock Exchange Group (ATHEX) and Mysten Labs, a primary contributor to the Sui blockchain ecosystem. A recent blog post indicated that this venture aims to facilitate early and established businesses in listing their transferable securities, heralding a new era for company financing.

 ATHEX plans to leverage the EBB framework to offer digital certificates of securities on the Sui blockchain, thereby opening an innovative channel for corporate funding. The publicly shared vision for this application includes a system marked by transparent supervision, robust security features, and seamless transferability of digital assets. As a pioneering effort, the EBB will serve as a meta-layer atop ATHEX’s existing order routing infrastructure, marrying traditional finance mechanisms with cutting-edge blockchain technology. 
 The EBB is designed to enhance liquidity for corporate funding endeavors, aiding enterprises in their capital-raising ventures. While the project is still undergoing evaluation, its implementation depends on ATHEX’s final decision to integrate blockchain solutions for their financial instruments.

Singaporean fintech launches USDC-powered Visa card with Swiss bank Fiat24,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 18:07:04.973815,"Singaporean fintech SafePal has made an investment into Swiss bank Fiat24 and jointly launched a crypto Visa card and in-app banking service with US Coin (USDC) as the default deposit currency. 
According to the March 7 announcement, the feature will be live on version 4.5.0 of the SafePal mobile wallet, subject to approval from Apple’s App Store and Google Play. ""Unlike typical Visa cards, the transactions on-chain on [USDC] Arbitrum provide a transparent, immutable ledger with faulty transfers reversible—but faulty transfers can still be reversed with our banking system,"" said Yang Lan, co-founder of Fiat24.
Meanwhile, Veronica Wong, CEO and co-founder of SafePal, explained that after users create a USDC mobile wallet, the funds can then be sent to accounts at traditional financial institutions. In addition, users can swap crypto across more than 40 blockchains into their bank accounts and use fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, euro, or Swiss Franc, for transactions and expenses. Developers further stated:

 ""After creating the bank accounts in the SafePal mobile wallet, the credentials are minted as NFTs on Arbitrum (an Ethereum Layer 2 rollup), ensuring all related transactions are securely and transparently recorded on-chain. The crypto Visa cards are also linked to third-party payment platforms like Paypal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay, enhancing the convenience for users.""

SafePal currently operates as a self-custody wallet and claims it has approximately 10 million users worldwide. Shortly after the crypto winter of 2021-2022, the firm's CEO Veronica Wong told Cointelegraph that ""the malpractice of centralized platforms has indeed catalyzed the adoption of self-custody solutions. This should not just be a temporary surge of interest, but a key impetus to strengthen the adoption of self-management for assets.""
Since the collapse of centralized finance entities such as FTX and Celsius, self-custody wallets have been rising in popularity. On Dec. 7, 2023, Jack Dorsey’s Block launched a self-custody wallet solution with access in over 95 countries. On Aug. 10, 2023, cross-chain wallet BitKeep changed its name to Bitget Wallet after securing a $30 million investment from the exchange to grow its multichain swap platform.

Pantera Plans to Acquire Large Solana Stake From FTX Estate,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 18:07:06.916150,"

  Cover image via U.Today


Pantera Capital is reportedly raising funds to purchase a significant amount of Solana tokens from the bankrupt estate of FTX, the digital asset exchange. 
According to Bloomberg, Pantera Capital, which manages $5.2 billion in assets, is hoping to acquire up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens. 
This acquisition could represent a substantial share of the tokens owned by FTX, offering a discounted rate to investors willing to commit to a four-year vesting period.
Strategic acquisition and market impact 
Pantera's initiative to secure a large stake in Solana stems from the available 41.1 million SOL tokens within the FTX estate. 
By acquiring these tokens at a 39% discount, Pantera aims to provide its investors with a lucrative opportunity while also assisting FTX liquidators in reallocating assets to creditors without destabilizing the token's market value. 
This move is particularly significant given Solana's impressive performance on the cryptocurrency market, which has seen a nearly 650% increase over the past year.
Pantera Capital, founded by Dan Morehead, a former head at Tiger Management, has a rich history of pioneering in the cryptocurrency investment space. 
The firm launched the United States' first cryptocurrency fund in 2013 and has been a leader in blockchain venture funding. Its portfolio management strategy spans passive, hedge and venture investments in digital currencies and blockchain technology.
Solana's price performance  
Solana's market value has shown remarkable growth. It has surged by a whopping 14% in the last 24 hours alone. It is currently trading at $147.05, according to CoinGecko data.
This surge is part of a broader trend that saw the cryptocurrency's value multiply following the FTX collapse in November 2022.

"Bitcoin Call Options at $70,000 Indicate Bullish Trend, Expert Reveals",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 18:07:08.735187,"Key Points

Bitcoin options are indicating a bullish sentiment as per the strike positioning and put-call ratio for March’s expiry.
A significant concentration of call options at a $70,000 strike price is seen for both weekly and monthly expiries on Deribit.

Bitcoin options are demonstrating a positive outlook, as revealed by the strike positioning and put-call ratio for the end of March, according to one market analyst.
The recent surge of Bitcoin to a new record high has resulted in the highest instruments traded by volume being monthly and mid-month expiry call options with a strike price of $70,000, as stated by Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex.
Call Options Concentration
This accumulation of call options at the $70,000 strike price is evident for both the end of the week and the end of March expiries on Deribit, the world’s largest Bitcoin options platform.
Kooner suggests that the current put-call ratio of Bitcoin options indicates traders are showing a bullish bias. The put-call ratio has remained below 0.6 consistently for the first time in half a year, with the 24-hour put-call ratio displaying an even more positive outlook of 0.47.
Implied Volatility Decreases
The global put-call ratio for Bitcoin options is currently at 0.6. A put-call ratio of less than 1 implies bullish sentiment, indicating more interest in potential upside (calls). Conversely, a put-call ratio greater than 1 usually implies bearish sentiment, indicating more interest in downside protection (puts).
The Bitfinex head of derivatives also highlighted the recent decrease in implied volatility in the options market, indicating lower volatility expectations among traders in the past 24 hours. As a result, the premium for options has dropped across all strike prices, making it cheaper to take on positions. Deribit’s implied volatility index for Bitcoin fell to 72% from 77% in the past 24 hours.
A decline in implied volatility values often leads to a decrease in option premiums, as the expectation of a lack of future volatility compared to the past allows for lower risk for options market participants.
Options are derivative contracts that give a trader the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option provides the right to buy, and a put offers the right to sell. A trader who buys put options is generally bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish.",['BTC'],https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9dc4e35539f471eb408af/

Although blockchain technology seems like a natural fit for exchange-related mechanisms, the distribution of EBB within the Sui ecosystem is highlighted as one of the first to utilize the technology in this manner. EBB will be deployed as a blockchain-based meta-layer over the existing order routing system at ATHEX.
According to the blog post, this tool will provide liquidity for business proposals to companies seeking to raise funds. The announcement mentioned that the project collaboration is still under evaluation and depends on performance and ATHEX’s choice to adopt blockchain technology to host its new tool.

Sui Network and Blockchain Initiatives
Sui Network, a Layer-1 blockchain ecosystem that launched its mainnet in May 2023 and focuses on crypto asset ownership, has been gaining attention. A few months after the mainnet launch, Sui took steps to simplify Web3 logins for users of Sui-supported applications by allowing logins using Google, Facebook, and Twitch credentials through a new zero-knowledge-focused feature, zkLogin.
Since its launch, Sui Network has gained popularity for managing high transaction volumes while maintaining low transaction fees. In February 2024, the Sui Foundation partnered with the American University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates to launch a Blockchain Academy aimed at increasing students’ awareness of blockchain technology and its applicability in creating applications and platforms.
In an interview, Sui Foundation General Manager Greg Siourounis stated that the purpose of this university initiative was to educate people about blockchain usage while providing the right tools.

"Presale Kripto 2024: Fenomena BlockDAG dan RETIK, Serta Ulasan NEAR Terkini",COIN_MARKET_CAP,blockchainmedia.id,2024-03-07 18:07:14.849122,"Presale kripto 2024 memang tak pernah sunyi sejak Ethereum memperkenalkan konsep Initial Coin Offering (ICO) pada 2014. Kini ada kripto lain yang diklaim fenomenal dalam konteks presale, yakni BlockDAG, RETIK. Bagaimana perbandingannya dengan Near Protocol (NEAR) sebagai pemain cukup lama di ranah kripto?   Dalam lanskap cryptocurrency yang terus berkembang dengan cepat, tahap presale kripto seringkali menawarkan kesempatan emas bagi investor awal untuk masuk ke pasar. Memasuki tahun 2024, dari sekian banyak presale di luar sana, ada BlockDAG yang sedang menggelar penggalangan dana mereka. Secara ringkas BlockDAG fokus pada mempermudah proses dan menekan biaya penambangan aset kripto. 
Presale Kripto 2024 dari BlockDAG di Sektor Pertambangan   Di pusat kegembiraan presale kripto tahun 2024 adalah BlockDAG, proyek yang diklaim tidak hanya menarik minat investor dari platform yang sudah mapan seperti NEAR Protocol dan presale Retik Finance (RETIK),  tetapi juga menunjukkan kapasitas yang kuat untuk pertumbuhan dan inovasi.   Dengan presale awal yang berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari US$2,9 juta, BlockDAG berada pada lintasan yang menunjukkan potensi return on investment yang apik.   BlockDAG adalah proyek kripto yang fokus pada penambangan kripto, mulai dari menggunakan perangkat mobile seperti smart phone dan tablet, hingga hardware kelas atas berjenis ASIC.   Alat tambang kripto, disebut mining rig, diklaim jauh lebih efisien dibandingkan dengan piranti keras sejenis. Hasilnya adalah lebih hemat listrik dan memaksimalkan reward yang diperoleh.   Selain itu BlockDAG memiliki produk X1 mobile program untuk menambang kripto secara mudah menggunakan perangkat ponsel ataupun tablet.         Ada lagi seri X10, berupa ASIC yang jauh lebih compact dan efisien. ASIC yang satu ini diklaim bisa menghasilkan hash rate 100 MH/s dengan konsumsi energi minimal (40W), menawarkan pendapatan harian hingga 200 BDAG.   Tipe tertinggi, yakni X100, memiliki hash rate sebesar 2 TH/s dengan konsumsi daya sebesar 1800 W. X100 dirancang untuk penambangan berkinerja tinggi. Pendapatan harian bisa mencapai hingga 2.000 BDAG! Dengan menggunakan algoritma SHA-256, X100 juga dapat menambang Bitcoin dan Kaspa. X100 dirancang untuk beradaptasi secara mulus dengan berbagai pengaturan. 
Keunggulan NEAR Protocol  NEAR Protocol didirikan oleh Erik Trautman, yang berpengalaman cukup lama di dunia dan bisnis teknologi informasi. Tangan kanannya, yakni Illia Polosukhin dikenal luas pernah berkarir di Google dan ada Alexander Skidanov, seorang ahli ilmu komputer dengan pengalaman di Microsoft dan memSQL.   Untuk meningkatkan kecepatan pemrosesan transaksi secara signifikan, NEAR menggunakan teknologi Nightshade. Teknik sharding ini memungkinkan pemrosesan transaksi secara paralel di berbagai rantai terbagi dengan menetapkan set validator yang berbeda, sehingga memperluas throughput keseluruhan blockchain, untuk memproses hingga 100.000 transaksi per detik   Sistem Near juga mempermudah perancangan aplikasi terdesentralisasi (dApps) dengan proses pendaftaran pengguna yang sudah familiar bagi kebanyakan orang. Ini juga menyediakan komponen-komponen yang fleksibel untuk pengembang, memudahkan inisiasi proyek yang melibatkan token contract atau NFT. 
Retik Finance (RETIK) yang Fokus di DeFi  Retik Finance adalah proyek kripto yang tergolong ambisius yang baru saja menyelesaikan tahap presale kripto mereka yang bernilai US$32 juta, dan siap untuk listed di beberapa crypto exchange.   RETIK fokus pada pengembangan DeFi agar lebih mudah diakses oleh khalayak kebanyakan, tidak hanya dari kalangan yang paham dunia kripto.   Sebagai inovator baru di sektor decentralized finance (DeFi), karena melahirkan sejumlah produk yang sama sekali unik dengan penyedia lainnya, yang bertujuan untuk memberdayakan konsumen dan mengubah pengelolaan aset keuangan.   Tujuannya untuk menjembatani keuangan tradisional dan digital menawarkan pengguna akses ke peluang dan alat terdesentralisasi, termasuk Retik Pay, Retik Debit Card, dan Retik Wallet. Fitur-fitur ini telah mempopulerkan proyek karena aksesibilitas dan desain yang ramah pengguna, menandai Retik Finance sebagai teknologi inovatif dalam DeFi.   Konsep DeFi mengatasi banyak keterbatasan sistem keuangan tradisional dengan memanfaatkan teknologi blockchain dan smart contract. Ini memastikan meningkatkan keamanan, transparansi, dan efisiensi, membuka jalan untuk sektor keuangan yang lebih demokratis dan terdesentralisasi.","['NEAR', '2024', '2024', 'RETIK', 'CIN']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9dc47e0f8a513810944d6/
Decentralized Lending Market Platform Lava Set to Launch,COIN_MARKET_CAP,COINTURK NEWS,2024-03-07 18:07:17.854735,"You can also read this news on COINTURK NEWS: Decentralized Lending Market Platform Lava Set to Launch
The cryptocurrency market’s rise continues alongside ongoing developments in the blockchain sector. The decentralized lending market platform Lava announced it will commence operations on March 7th. According to a press release shared with the public dated March 7th, Lava’s infrastructure will enable automatic market makers (AMMs) to reduce impermanent losses and optimize liquidity across multiple blockchain networks.
Executive Comments on the Matter
Recharge Capital‘s crypto asset managing partner John Lo considers impermanent loss a problem for all liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges. Lo commented on the issue:

“This is not only a major pain point for users but also a problem that causes a regression towards traditional architecture and hinders efficient markets on the chain.”

Often seen as one of the biggest weaknesses of decentralized finance (DeFi), impermanent loss occurs when the price of a token changes after a user deposits it into a liquidity pool-based automatic market maker as part of yield farming, which is known as a type of investment where a person lends tokens to earn rewards.
This situation is among the main reasons why institutional investors hesitate to invest in the DeFi space. According to Lo, the ability to reduce temporary losses will create a new paradigm for DeFi protocols:

“DeFi is opening a new dimension where it can democratize market making instead of reverting to traditional financial architecture and enable market making and capital efficiency to compete against centralized platforms. Alternative market makers are already providing various benefits compared to traditional architecture, and Lava is trying to complement these benefits, if not combine them.”


Noteworthy Details About Lava
Recharge Capital supported Lava’s new platform aims to empower liquidity providers and create more depth in the crypto market; this refers to the market liquidity of a crypto asset or security based on the number of pending buy and sell orders.
Lava claims to be the first platform aiming to solve the impermanent loss in the DeFi space by providing arbitrage between market maker rates through collateralization and lending of liquidity positions. The platform will simplify yield optimization for passive liquidity providers while enabling users to arbitrage between DeFi and centralized finance protocols to find an effective market rate.
Lava is currently a multi-chain platform available in the Arbitrum and Base blockchain ecosystems. The protocol plans to expand its services to other blockchain ecosystems in the future.

Tesla and SpaceX’s Bitcoin Portfolio Revealed: Here are the Details!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CO NEWS,2024-03-07 18:07:33.594459,"
According to information uncovered by blockchain tracker Arkham, Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX are reported to hold a substantial amount of Bitcoin.
As per the data revealed by Arkham, Tesla currently holds 11.51K BTC worth $780 million spread across 68 different addresses, while SpaceX has 9.29K BTC worth $560 million spread across 28 different addresses.
The extraordinary holdings of one of the world’s most famous entrepreneurs reflect significant optimism around the first digital currency.

How much Bitcoin Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX hold was detected by Arkham and added to the platform: Here are the reports!
Details of Tesla and SpaceX’s Bitcoin Holdings Added to Arkham

In a noteworthy revelation in the crypto world, it has been reported that Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX hold a massive amount of Bitcoin, as uncovered by blockchain tracker Arkham. These holdings, exceeding $68,000, have garnered notable attention among global crypto market traders and investors, surpassing a new All-Time High (ATH) for BTC above $68,000 this week.
These accumulations are distributed across nearly 100 different addresses, showcasing Musk’s extraordinary confidence in the world’s first digital asset. Meanwhile, as the Bitcoin halving approaches, the statement mentioned above further strengthens investor sentiment around Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin continued its upward movement today, briefly experiencing a slight dip.
According to the information provided by Arkham, Tesla currently holds 11.51K BTC worth $780 million spread across 68 different addresses, while SpaceX has 9.29K BTC worth $560 million spread across 28 different addresses. Arkham went further in its research by identifying on-chain fund flows matching Tesla and SpaceX’s financial statements.
Interestingly, it was revealed that Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in January 2021 and sold it in two separate instances. According to Arkham, Tesla’s first BTC sale date is based on a $272 million sale in the first quarter of 2021. On the other hand, the second sale date is based on a $936 million BTC sale in the second quarter of 2022.
In addition to this data, Arkham highlighted another interesting event where Tesla allowed the purchase of Tesla (cars) with Bitcoin between March 24 and May 12, 2021. In line with this event, the tracker identified a Tesla car purchase associated with Tesla’s BTC assets, leading to further implications.
The extraordinary holdings of one of the world’s most famous entrepreneurs reflect significant optimism around the first digital currency. With Bitcoin already reaching new highs fueled by Bitcoin ETFs and pre-halving bullish market sentiment, greater pump expectations persist as the halving is yet to occur.
Bitcoin Price Rises
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price recorded a 0.71% increase in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $66,734. The recent ATH above $68,000, along with bullish market expectations fueled by ETFs and pre-halving sentiment, has further heightened optimism.
The displayed bull run of the token with a 54.97% monthly increase indicates that Musk’s companies’ accumulations have contributed to this optimism. Crypto enthusiasts largely remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s strong price movement, attributing it to the massive holdings of Tesla and SpaceX contributing to the positivity in an environment where the halving is approaching.

The Dogwifhat price has plunged 16% to trade for $1.7867 as of 05:20 a.m. EST time as trading volume plummeted 50%.
Meme season appears to be dissipating, and WIF is no exception with peers in the sector, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki Inu (FLOKI), all posting steep declines.

It comes in the wake of traders who had taken long positions on Dogwifhat cashing in on the gains made over the past few days, including the 50% pump on Wednesday.

Dogwifhat Price Prediction As Meme Coins Dump
Meanwhile, the Dogwifhat price still has upside potential as it continues to hold within the ascending parallel channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is inching north, suggesting rising momentum. If the trajectory of this momentum indicator sustains, it could soon execute a buy signal by crossing above the yellow band of the signal line.
Increased buyer momentum could see the Dogwifhat price extend north to overcome resistance due to the midline of the channel, which coincides with the horizontal line at $1.9482. A flip of this roadblock into support would pave way for an extended move north. This could see the Dogwifhat price extend to the top of the market range at $2.2726.
In a highly bullish case, the Dogwifhat price could extend the gains, shattering the roadblock with hopes to record a higher high above it. The next logical target would be the $2.5000 threshold. Such a move would constitute a 45% climb above current levels.



TradingView: WIF/USDT 1-day chart
Conversely, a rejection from the midline of the channel could see the Dogwifhat price drop. A slip below the lower boundary of the channel could send the WIF price all the way to the $1.5000 psychological level.
For the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, however, the price must break and close below the 50% Fibonacci level of $1.3059.
Meanwhile, while the Dogwifhat price struggles to sustain the bullish outlook, Solana competitor Smog is defying market gravity with another pump that took it’s weekly gains to 335%.





Promising Alternative To Dogwifhat
Smog is the latest Solana meme coin sensation that’s become one of the most talked-about meme coins in 2024 after a debut on Jupiter DEX.

Smog also promises to unleash the mother of all airdrops, and is committed to surpassing even the landmark $700 million airdrop by Solana’s JUP. Towards this endeavor, the project has allocated 35% of the total token supply (1.4 billion tokens).  Project participants can accumulate airdrop points by engaging in a campaign on Zealy.

The growth of SMOG’s airdrop campaign is reflected in the number of airdrop quest completions on Zealy exploding to more than one million.
$SMOG’s powerful break higher has also seen the number of token holders surge dramatically in just a few days, with holders currently totaling upwards of 49,420.

Bitcoin price is above $67,000, with some altcoins continuing to diverge positively. Macro-economic developments may not affect the markets as much as before, but potential surprises from the Fed this year could be troubling for investors. Therefore, upcoming announcements from the Fed side still hold potential risk.
Fed Statements on March 7
As this article is being prepared, Fed member Bowman made some important remarks. Following the poor January data, the significance of the new inflation data to be announced next week has increased. Moreover, the employment and wage increase data (for February) to be announced tomorrow are also of critical importance. Bowman said today;

“January inflation data suggest that progress in reducing inflation could be slower in the future. Recent employment data show that the tight labor market continues. Considering the frequency of data revisions, we will maintain our cautious approach when evaluating any policy stance changes. I expect the decline in inflation to continue, but I see a set of upward inflation risks in my outlook. The current policy stance appears to be restrictive and appropriately calibrated to reduce inflation. If the data show that progress on inflation has halted or reversed, I will be willing to raise the policy interest rate. If the incoming data show that inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2% target, gradually lowering the policy interest rate will eventually be appropriate. I don’t think we are at that point yet.”


Bowman’s statements mean that if we see surprisingly poor data, the possibility of an interest rate cut could decrease further. Therefore, the data to be announced tomorrow and next week are of key importance.

What is Energo’s TSL token? Learn About Its Working & Use Cases,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 18:07:55.512534,"The Energo ecosystem has been created to connect energy producers with consumers, and TSL is its native cryptocurrency.
Energo is a decentralized app-based ecosystem built for a future DAE (Decentralized Autonomous Energy Community). The core of this ecosystem comprises Qtum and a decentralized system designed for the measurement, registries, transactions, and settlement of clean energy in local Micro-grids.
This blog describes a peer-to-peer DAE community, where the Energo system is embedded with a cryptocurrency called the TSL token. This cryptocurrency’s holders will be entitled to access the distributed energy storage system.
How Can Energo Benefit Energy Producers and Consumers?
Energo is built to link energy producers with distinct capacities to the consumers of diverse needs. Its goal is to consume clean energy first within the community, increase energy efficiency and reliability, eliminate intermediaries of energy trading, boost profits for energy producers and retailers, and slash costs for energy users. With that vision, Energo aims to channel the physical construction, informational structure, and value system of the future smart grids. It strives to establish a truly decentralized autonomous energy community.
Energo also offers a solution to machine-to-machine energy demand. Electric vehicles of tomorrow will apply their digital ID and digital wallet on the blockchain to pay for the electricity they receive through any given charging station. Both the charging and payment process can be done unattended. Besides, the efficiency of clean energy supply and consumption in any given community can also be maximized.
The electric power industry is moving from a very much centralized generation system to a decentralized one, a smaller-scale production model. Therefore, if this trend continues, every household will have a power-generating facility installed in the near future. That’s also the vision of the Energo ecosystem.
These facilities will generate enough electricity to meet household demands and supply local communities with a surplus, which may prompt energy trading with many households. Imagine a future where every household has installed PV and enjoys a power surplus that can be supplied to other users. When electricity is traded within the local community, the costs of distributing power, building transmission lines, and expanding generation capacity will significantly decrease.
Such a future would fundamentally transform the renewable energy landscape, where resources and capacities are unevenly distributed. Power surplus will be consumed within the local community first while being complementary to the original power source. 
Energo and the Renewable Energy Sector
The renewable energy sector relies heavily on subsidies from pro-clean-energy governments, but these subsidies are dwindling, with Germany already pulling out its subsidy. Against such a backdrop, a new solution, independent of subsidies and guided by free market rules, is much needed. 
Something like an electricity market, where free trading happens, and it also benefits all stakeholders. Such a market is a double-edged sword, challenging and presenting new opportunities to traditional power grids, businesses, and operations.
Energo’s vision for the future is to find better solutions to manage a massive decentralized future energy grid, which can sometimes be unreliable. Such a vision allows participants to maximize the use of electricity generated locally. It delivers evident benefits: cutting power distribution costs and energy loss, managing the local power grid better, and eventually leading to decentralized autonomous energy. 
The TSL Token
The TSL token, which is also a short form for Tesla, is the token that represents its owner’s access to power in distributed energy storage equipment. Future prosumers and electricity users must own TSL tokens to store electricity in energy storage equipment. 
A commission fee on the user-stored energy in the distributed energy storage equipment is charged every 15 minutes to guarantee the efficient and fair use of public resources. 
The allocation has been done as 80% of the proceeds go to the storage equipment owners, meaning energy suppliers’ proceeds correspond to the percentage of stored energy they contribute to the grid. 10% goes to the purpose of educating the market and new users. 
For instance, TSLs of small denominations are given for free to first-time users to facilitate their experience. Another 10% goes to the Energo network. Energo issues 1,000,000,000 TSLs in total, and the number of tokens remains constant. There will be no more issuance in the future.
In the first quarter of 2017, Energo completed the blockchain Version ALPHA and the development of Energy Exchange on the Android platform. In the early days, Ebergo claims to have built the blockchain by itself and spent a lot of energy.
Quantum Blockchain and Energo 
Energo is a consortium blockchain developed using the Qtum system. It comprises future distributed energy storage equipment that serves as full nodes. Energo is focused on developing distributed autonomous energy (DAE), and its blockchain technology is optimized for the energy sector. 
In addition, it offers superb capacity to handle energy information flow and value transfer and guarantees the security, stability, and partial decentralization of the entire DAE ecosystem.
Quantum Blockchain is a platform that facilitates the transfer of value and the development of decentralized applications through the Internet. It aims to connect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems and bring blockchain technology to the physical world.
Unlike smart contract platforms that rely on POW, a consensus protocol limited by resources and hardware, Qtum uses a more flexible consensus mechanism. This is because public and consortium blockchains have different requirements for consensus due to the other entities that access them. 
Qtum has both public and consortium blockchains that use different mechanisms. The public blockchain uses IPOS, a POS-based protocol that is decentralized, secure, reliable, and has a low threshold for participation. On the other hand, the consortium blockchain uses a combination of Proof of Time and Raft agreement to optimize computing power in a trusted network.
Current blockchain systems are often limited because they do not interact with the physical world. Most smart contracts are triggered from within the blockchain system, which means there is a lack of interaction with the outside world.
However, Qtum is different because it features Oracle and Data Feed functionalities that allow data from the physical world to trigger events in smart contracts, breaking the closed loop of smart contracts. 
Summary
Energo connects energy producers with diverse consumers to consume clean energy first, increase efficiency, eliminate intermediaries, boost profits, and reduce costs. TSL token represents the user’s access to power in distributed energy storage equipment. Quantum Blockchain connects Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems and enables data from the physical world to trigger events in smart contracts.

Bitcoin currently stands strong at over $67,000, while some alternative cryptocurrencies show an upward trend. Despite the previous diminished influence of macroeconomic events on the market, upcoming Federal Reserve announcements still pose a risk for investors. The market awaits these with cautious anticipation, aware that unexpected news could stir volatility.
Insights from a Federal Reserve Member
A Federal Reserve official, Bowman, has recently shared insights that could signal the future of market conditions. With January’s disappointing economic figures, the upcoming inflation and employment data receive heightened attention. The February employment and wage statistics are particularly crucial, as they might influence policy decisions. Bowman’s stance suggests a commitment to a cautious policy approach, ready to adjust interest rates if inflation deviates from its target.
Significance of Upcoming Economic Data
Bowman highlights the importance of the new inflation statistics due next week, and the employment data scheduled for release soon. These figures have gained critical significance, as they could dictate the Federal Reserve’s policy direction. A deviation in the data could lead to a reconsideration of interest rate cuts, placing a spotlight on the impending announcements.
The Federal Reserve’s communication has made it clear that any surprising downturn in economic data may dampen the prospects of an interest rate reduction. This reinforces the weight of the forthcoming economic indicators. Market participants are advised to keep a close watch on the employment and inflation data, as they could be pivotal in shaping the Federal Reserve’s monetary strategy.
In summary, the financial community braces for potential market swings as the Federal Reserve prepares to review key economic indicators. Bitcoin’s price resilience faces a test, with the Fed’s policy response to incoming data being a determining factor for investor sentiment and market stability.

Such large-scale transactions typically spark intrigue within the crypto community, often interpreted as a move by a major investor to liquidate their assets. This transfer, notably, coincides with Ethereum's recent surge to $3,800, marking its highest price point since January 2022.

ETH's recent ascent, witnessing a notable 9% increase over the past week, has been overshadowed by Bitcoin's price monumental surge, as the pioneer cryptocurrency soared to unprecedented heights.

This transfer, in particular, raises eyebrows as it aligns with Ethereum's upward trajectory, prompting speculation about the motives driving such a substantial movement of assets.

What's the Hidden Danger Behind Spot Ethereum ETFs? BitMEX Analysts Announced!,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Bitcoin Sistemi EN,2024-03-07 18:08:11.702534,"After the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, all eyes turned to spot Ethereum ETFs.
While investors expect ETH ETFs to also receive approval, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects the Ethereum spot ETF to have a 70% chance of being approved in May, while JPMorgan analysts said they see no more than a 50% chance of spot ETH ETF approval by May.
Related News: This Decision Starts the Ethereum Rally! So Will the SEC Approve? JP Morgan Evaluated! 
While there is no full consensus on Ethereum ETFs, a new report came from BITMEX analysts.
While speculation continues as to whether spot Ethereum ETFs awaiting approval by the SEC will provide returns from staking in Ethereum, BitMEX analysts stated that the lack of staking income in spot ETH ETFs may reduce the attractiveness of ETH ETFs.
According to The Block, analysts emphasized that staking returns are a very important factor in the success of the Ethereum network.
At this point, analysts pointed out that ETH staking return is an important factor for institutional investors and ETF buyers and said the following.

“Ethereum staking rewards currently yield around 3.7%.
While this return may not be significant for all Ethereum holders, it remains an important consideration for institutional investors and ETF buyers.
At this point, it's certainly possible for the raw Ethereum price to underperform Bitcoin over the long term, but Ethereum stakers can earn higher returns than Bitcoin holders with the benefit of staking yield. That's why staking return is an important consideration for institutional investors and ETF buyers.
Therefore, if companies applying for ETFs cannot offer returns from Ethereum staking in ETFs, the attractiveness of spot Ethereum ETFs may diminish, even if approved.”

BitMEX Research analysts argued that if spot ETH ETFs are launched in the US without staking returns, existing holders and stakers may be less willing to move their assets into an ETF.
Stating that there may be possible solutions to this, analysts said that ETF issuers are desperate for staking because the SEC is “willing to put every possible obstacle in front of ETF providers.”
This means that including staking yield in ETH ETFs could be a step too far, analysts added.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Prices Plummet – Here’s Why,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 18:08:19.568243,"The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) has begun to decline after spiking for 10 days straight, rising from $0.08 to $0.2, representing a staggering 150% increase. The bullish run made the indicators overextended, and the bulls started to see reasons to take profit. As bulls began taking profit, the price declined from $0.2 to $0.12, but bulls were able to push the price slightly upward. Despite the attempt, the price has now declined by around 10% in the last 24 hours, indicating a bearish trend.
Analyst’s Perspective
Amid the decline, analyst Claudia Turvey (@ClaudiaTurvey1D) shared her insights on why she will still hold on to Dogecoin. According to Turvey, there are a few key factors that make Dogecoin (DOGE) an attractive investment option:

Significant Growth: Turvey acknowledges that Dogecoin has shown significant growth, suggesting its potential for future price appreciation.
Potential for Development and Adoption: The analyst believes that Dogecoin has the potential for further development and adoption, which could drive its value higher.

The Plummeting Shiba Inu (SHIB)
The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also been plummeting for the past three days after days of upward rise. This can be also be attributed to investors taking profit after the price has risen for more than a week.
Community Sentiment
Regarding the SHIB price movement, a community member with the handle @army_shiba shared their perspective:



“$SHIB has a nice and healthy chart. Some are taking profits, others are buying the dip for the next leg. Forming a nice pattern rn. If btc doesn’t spoil, it will continue with the rise.”
The recent price declines of DOGE and SHIB highlight the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, where profit-taking and market sentiment can significantly impact price movements.

"Which New Tokens Will Grow 10x During This Crypto Bull Run? Investors Pour Funds Into SMOG, FWIF, and BTCMTX",COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 18:08:22.669923,"As the crypto market enters the second phase of the 2024 bull run, a fresh influx of investors is observed. While some opt for major tokens, astute investors recognize that the greatest gains lie within lesser-known tokens with substantial potential.
Presently, three tokens are seeing a lot of new investment: Smog (SMOG), Frog With Hat (FWIF), and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX). These have rightfully piqued the interest of crypto enthusiasts, and we delve into the reasons behind their prominence here.
Smog (SMOG) Burning Other Meme Coins On Its Way To The Top



Smog (SMOG) emerges as a rising meme coin garnering attention within crypto communities. Featuring a distinctive character sparking numerous discussions, it positions itself as a potential standout among Solana’s meme coins. Despite the journey ahead, the enthusiasm among crypto investors suggests it’s already on the path to success.
Following the footsteps of successful predecessors like Bonk and Myro, SMOG has witnessed substantial growth. Notably, its decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes recently surpassed those of Uniswap.
Moreover, SMOG has gained traction on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), achieving a $2 million market cap on Jupiter. The upcoming airdrop hints at further growth potential, while staking offers an attractive Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 42%, providing added incentives for investors to consider this token.
With its remarkable growth trajectory, SMOG could potentially outshine the achievements of SPONGE, which experienced a 50-fold increase from $2 million to $100 million. As one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in, particularly with the impending airdrop, we strongly recommend monitoring SMOG’s evolution.
Watch Out For FrogWifHat 



Frog Wif Hat (FWIF) has captured the attention of the crypto community with its unique concept. This meme coin features a frog adorned in a beret and clutching a baguette, resonating strongly with enthusiasts of such tokens.
Amidst a resurgence in the popularity of meme coins over the past year, Frog Wif Hat appears poised to ride this wave. The titular character, consistently portrayed with its signature beret and baguette, exudes a distinctive persona.
Beyond its meme appeal, Frog Wif Hat offers a comprehensive roadmap aimed at achieving a market capitalization of $100 million. The initial phase, labeled “aperitif,” prioritizes initiatives such as enhancing the token’s visibility on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and establishing a robust social media presence.
Subsequent phases, “hors d’oeuvre” and “bon appetit,” will focus on marketing endeavors, bolstering the token’s presence on the Solana network, attaining the $100 million market cap objective, and venturing into NFT art creation.
With 100% of the token supply already in circulation and a total supply of 1 billion tokens, Frog Wif Hat’s smart contract has undergone an audit. Notably, the token is tradable on Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange in the cryptocurrency space.
Bitcoin Minetrix Could See A Big Boost From The Bull Market



Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) functions as a cloud mining platform, utilizing tokens to streamline operations and improve user experience. Unlike traditional Bitcoin mining, which can be intimidating for many, the platform and its associated token enable participation in Bitcoin mining for anyone. This inclusivity opens doors for investors to earn credits for additional Bitcoin mining by staking BTCMTX tokens, effectively addressing concerns about reliability and fraud often linked with cloud mining.
The project distinguishes itself through its steadfast commitment to security and transparency. Users can conveniently purchase and stake BTCMTX tokens within the ecosystem, utilizing wallets like MetaMask, which are compatible with Ethereum.
Advantages of the project include minimal initial costs and a user-friendly, secure interface. The onboarding process is seamless, from token acquisition to selecting the buy-and-stake option, ultimately leading to Bitcoin rewards.
The team has devised a strategic roadmap for the project. Post-launch, primary objectives include securing listings on exchanges, launching an extensive marketing campaign, developing desktop and mobile applications, and expanding the team. Additionally, discussions with reputable cloud mining companies are underway to establish stake-to-mine contracts, potentially driving significant growth.
In the upcoming phase, users will have the ability to withdraw Bitcoin directly to their wallets and experience stake-to-mine interfaces on both desktop and mobile platforms. Looking ahead, there are plans to introduce the ability for users to trade hash power for mining credits. The team remains dedicated to effective marketing, cloud mining rentals, and overall business excellence.
Since the presale, Bitcoin Minetrix has demonstrated outstanding performance. The BTCMTX token has raised nearly $11.8 million and is currently priced at $0.0139. Interested buyers can acquire BTCMTX using credit cards, ETH, USDT, or BNB. Additionally, an exciting Gleam giveaway offers participants a chance to win a $30,000 mine drop prize.
Conclusion
In the realm of cryptocurrency investing, there’s no shortage of intriguing projects and tokens to consider. However, the key lies in staying attentive to fresh concepts and scrutinizing how teams aim to realize their ambitions. Tokens like Smog (SMOG), Frog Wif Hat (FWIF), and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) exhibit promising indicators, making them worthy of your careful consideration.

Trading expert sets Bitcoin’s price for April halving,COIN_MARKET_CAP,TheBitTimes,2024-03-07 18:08:26.014232,"
After hitting an all-time high, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced volatility, and the market anticipates the next price action at a time when several catalysts, including the upcoming halving, support the maiden cryptocurrency.
In assessing Bitcoin’s next price target, crypto trading expert Trading Shot established potential price targets in a TradingView post on March 7 based on the asset’s historical patterns observed since the bottom of November 2022. 
According to the expert, Bitcoin has exhibited a consistent pattern since the bottom, characterized by a substantial approximately 100% surge, followed by a triangle formation that foreshadows the rally’s peak. Subsequently, there is a notable 20% decline, typically taking the form of a channel down.

Based on this pattern, the analyst projected a further 96.43% increase, akin to previous waves. At the same time, he suggested that a correction of around 20%, expected to land near $60,000.

“The latest high volatility of the past 3 days resembles those Triangle patterns before the peak. A +96.43% rise, similar to the previous Wave, gets completed around $75500. If BTC continues to replicate those patterns, then a -20% correction should coincide with April’s Halving,” he said. 

What next for Bitcoin after ATH?
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s recent journey to a new all-time high was sparked by several key milestones impacting the general cryptocurrency landscape. Notably, a series of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that began trading in January are critical catalysts for Bitcoin’s current rally. At the same time, the upcoming halving event has heightened expectations.
Bitcoin halvings, occurring every four years, reduce mining rewards by half, slowing new Bitcoin creation. Historically, they have influenced Bitcoin prices, attributed to scarcity by analysts and fueled previous price rallies.
Overall, the timing of the record high is significant, considering that the asset typically achieves a new peak after the halving. This could indicate that the market is experiencing an earlier, sharper, shorter bull cycle that might follow a correction.
However, the market has expressed concerns with Bitcoin correcting by almost 10% after reaching an all-time high. Notably, on March 5, crypto on-chain data Analysis platform Santiment pointed out that buy-in-the-dip calls reached their highest level in a couple of months following the drop.

Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $66,804, with daily gains of 1.3%. Over the past seven days, BTC has increased about 6%.

Overall, Bitcoin’s next trajectory remains uncertain, considering that the asset is susceptible to factors such as increased profit-taking that could result in losses.

Premarket Movers in Focus: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Tesla (TSLA),COIN_MARKET_CAP,Tokenist,2024-03-07 18:08:27.838517,"
 Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.

In pre-market trading on Thursday, we’re watching two tech giants head in opposite directions. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) shares continued to rally, up nearly 4% after a surge on Wednesday following news of a major U.S. Army contract award. The $178 million deal to develop new targeting technology sent the data analytics firm’s stock soaring almost 10%.
Meanwhile, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) was trading lower, down nearly 1%, as it dealt with the fallout from alleged sabotage temporarily halting production at its new German electric vehicle factory.
Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) Stock Up After U.S Army Contract
Shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. surged Wednesday, closing at $26.16, up $2.35 or 9.87%, with pre-market trading showing a further 3.98% gain to $27.20 at the time of writing. The data analytics software company’s market cap stood at $57.885 billion, with a hefty PE ratio of 290.67 and earnings per share of $0.09 over the past 12 months. The 52-week range for the stock has been $7.19 to $26.75, with analysts’ 1-year target at $18.71, still well below current levels. The recent rise is likely attributed to a significant U.S. Army contract.
Palantir Technologies Inc. has been awarded a $178.4 million contract by the U.S. Army to develop a new ground station system called the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, or TITAN. The contract covers the development of 10 prototypes, including five advanced and five basic variants, and the integration of new technologies and transition to fielding.
TITAN is designed to provide access to space, high-altitude, aerial, and terrestrial sensors to offer actionable targeting information for enhanced mission command and long-range precision fires. Palantir’s solution aims to maximize soldiers’ usability and improve target recognition.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Falls Out of Top 10 Market Cap After German Factory Woes
Shares of Tesla Inc. slipped Wednesday, closing at $176.54, down $4.20 or 2.32%, with pre-market trading pointing to a further 0.88% decline to $174.99. The electric vehicle maker had a market capitalization of $562.243 billion. Its price-to-earnings ratio over the trailing 12 months was 40.96, with earnings per share of $4.31. Tesla’s 52-week range has been $152.37 to $299.29. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $205.55 on the stock, well above current levels.
Production at Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicle factory in Germany ground to a halt after alleged sabotage by a far-left group caused a loss of power. The Vulkangruppe activist group claimed responsibility, stating concerns over the plant’s environmental impact. Electrical cables were set on fire, prompting a police arson investigation and emergency response as damage cut electricity to the factory and surrounding towns.
Though locals had power restored within hours, Tesla remained dark as CEO Elon Musk criticized the “dumbest eco-terrorists” while Brandenburg’s interior minister decried the “perfidious attack” on infrastructure. The power outage coincided with protests by environmental groups against Tesla’s expansion in neighboring woodland areas.
The EV firm also recently lost its status as one of the largest ten companies in the US by market cap. 
Do you think Tesla will be able to recover in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Bitcoin (BTC) Halving Speculation Boosts Kelexo (KLXO) Presale Interest – Ethereum (ETH) and DogeCoin (DOGE) Bulls Join In,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CaptainAltcoin,2024-03-07 18:08:29.292840,"Big money is being made in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) right now and there is much speculation that these could continue throughout the month. Dogecoin (DOGE) has also seen massive growth in the last few days as memecoins pump across the market. But how high they could go and if investors should buy now remains unanswered.
There are also questions as to what could be behind these movements and what comes next. We attempt to analyze and answer all these questions to inform readers. We also present a growing opportunity within the market  Kelexo (KLXO).
Bullish Bitcoin (BTC) Set to Break Record
In what has been an amazing year for Bitcoin (BTC), it has nearly doubled in value in just three months. Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $67,815.46 at the time of writing, a massive upgrade compared to sixty days ago. With an 18% rise from 7 days ago, Bitcoin (BTC) is close to $68,000.
It seems like only a matter of time before Bitcoin (BTC) reaches its highest price ever. Predictions are that a new all-time high could be set at $84k or even as high as $102k after the halving. 
Ethereum (ETH) at $3.8K
Ethereum (ETH) briefly went above $3,800 in intra-week trading as it kept up momentum toward $4,000. It now trades over 16% above prices a week ago. Ethereum (ETH) is rising across charts with bullish signs that impress investors.
The most gains are seen compared to a month ago, with an over 63% improvement in that time. Ethereum (ETH) changes hands at $3,797.84 at the time of writing.
Is The Dogecoin (DOGE) Rising Over?
Some experts believe that Dogecoin (DOGE) rise may be ending as quickly as it began. Recall that Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a sharp uptrend, reaching $0.175 in under two days. It has continued growing, reaching $0.1893 at the time of writing.
Despite this 90% rise from a week ago, experts say that Dogecoin (DOGE) could stop growing by the end of the week. Investors should be on their toes but it should be noted that this is very speculative.
Kelexo (KLXO) Attracting Bulls
More funds have been invested into the DeFi project, Kelexo (KLXO) which is attempting to reform lending. It is a decentralized ecosystem for global lending. Many Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have picked it as the investment of choice.
It is cheap and this certainly affects how investors perceive it. Kelexo (KLXO) sells for $0.028. Investors appreciate low-cost assets since they have a lower risk of losses and could bring more returns from smaller capital.
The utility is another piece of the attraction. Projects like Kelexo (KLXO) that have significant real-world value are popular with investors. Creating value is the easiest path to success and investors look to be part of this. More investors could join the Kelexo (KLXO) presale soon, especially among veteran traders.
We think this is fitting for the prospects of the project.

SHIB Founder Ryoshi's Crucial 'Burn Message' Shared by Shiba Inu Team,COIN_MARKET_CAP,U_Today,2024-03-07 18:08:32.816169,"

  Cover image via U.Today


The Shiba Inu team’s leading specialist in social media marketing known to the community as Lucie has published a tweet, addressing the issue of Shibarium Shiba Inu burns. These token burns are supposed to be made by the developer team. They started in late November and then continued in December and January. However, since then, they have not burned any SHIB tokens.
Shiba Inu enthusiasts often ask what is happening and when these meme coin burns will resume. Lucie has cited the mysterious founder of SHIB, Ryoshi, on this issue.
Ryoshi's message cited by Shiba Inu's marketing lead
Lucie was indignant at SHIB enthusiasts posting messages on Twitter/X, demanding that SHIB developers do something about it. She cited Ryoshi’s message, addressed to those who complain about the way SHIB developers work. Here’s what the SHIB founder said, according to Lucie: ""What did you do for Shib's growth? How much have YOU burned?""
Then she suggested that if those who are unhappy about the way the SHIB ecosystem works should start burning SHIB themselves, and “develop better tools.” As for Lucie, she insists that she is happy with Shibarium and proud of it.

People who have never used #Shibarium and are whining about #SHIBARIUM burns 🤭 Really?!It's a community effort—you can't quote Ryoshi and on the same day cry, ""Dev, do something!"" So, before you throw stones, ask yourself, as Ryoshi said, 'What did you do for Shib's growth?…— 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | SHIB.IO 🧜🏼‍♀️ (@LucieSHIB) March 7, 2024

Previously, Lucie has stated many times that the higher Shibarium utility and adoption are, the more SHIB will eventually be burned through this layer-2 blockchain. Burns are conducted thanks to transaction fees paid in BONE; part of them is set aside for blockchain maintenance and part used for buying SHIB and then burning it. Around 40 billion SHIB have already been transferred to unspendable wallets, i.e., burned, by Shiba Inu developers since the end of November in this way.
Since January, they have been testing an automated burn mode on Puppynet.
146 million SHIB sent to furnace
According to the Shibburn cryptocurrency tracker, over the last 24 hours, various SHIB enthusiasts have succeeded in disposing of a decent amount of meme coins – more than 146 million SHIB in total.
The largest burn transaction contained 100,877,615 SHIB, and the second biggest one carried 38,500,000 SHIB. At press time, the second largest meme cryptocurrency SHIB is trading at $0.00003074.

Meme season appears to be dissipating, and WIF is no exception with peers in the sector, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki Inu (FLOKI), all posting steep declines.

It comes in the wake of traders who had taken long positions on Dogwifhat cashing in on the gains made over the past few days, including the 50% pump on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the only sector not to be mauled by investors was AI crypto coins, which saw double-digit gains amid the hype around the upcoming NVDIA 2024 GTC AI conference scheduled for March 18 to 21 in Silicon Valley.

Dogwifhat Price Prediction As Meme Coins Dump
Meanwhile, the Dogwifhat price still has upside potential as it continues to hold within the ascending parallel channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is inching north, suggesting rising momentum. If the trajectory of this momentum indicator sustains, it could soon execute a buy signal by crossing above the yellow band of the signal line.
Increased buyer momentum could see the Dogwifhat price extend north to overcome resistance due to the midline of the channel, which coincides with the horizontal line at $1.9482. A flip of this roadblock into support would pave way for an extended move north. This could see the Dogwifhat price extend to the top of the market range at $2.2726.
In a highly bullish case, the Dogwifhat price could extend the gains, shattering the roadblock with hopes to record a higher high above it. The next logical target would be the $2.5000 threshold. Such a move would constitute a 45% climb above current levels.

TradingView: WIF/USDT 1-day chart
Conversely, a rejection from the midline of the channel could see the Dogwifhat price drop. A slip below the lower boundary of the channel could send the WIF price all the way to the $1.5000 psychological level.
For the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, however, the price must break and close below the 50% Fibonacci level of $1.3059.
Meanwhile, while the Dogwifhat price struggles to sustain the bullish outlook, Solana competitor Smog is defying market gravity with another pump that took it’s weekly gains to 335%.

Promising Alternative To Dogwifhat
Smog is the latest Solana meme coin sensation that’s become one of the most talked-about meme coins in 2024 after a debut on Jupiter DEX.

Polygon (MATIC) Breaks Above the Decessive Phase: Here are the Targets for the Current Bull Run,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-07 18:08:39.418420,"The post Polygon (MATIC) Breaks Above the Decessive Phase: Here are the Targets for the Current Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Polygon is considered one of the strongest tokens in terms of fundamentals, with a quick recovery after a bearish pullback. The token did plunge below $1 during the latest bearish attack but managed quickly to regain the levels above. With this, the price has surged above the pattern that was stuck within a decisive phase, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish move. 
The price is rising at times when the volume has plunged by nearly 50% compared to the previous day. Does this indicate a halt in the bearish activity? If yes, will it intensify once the price recaptures the 2023 highs close to $1.5?
The MATIC price has been trading along a descending trend line since being rejected from its long-term ATH. The ascending support line supported the token during bearish pullbacks while also providing a solid foundation for a strong rebound. The recent rebound allowed the price to break through the upper resistance, implying the start of a new bullish spell, as occurred previously at the start of the 2021 bull run.



The weekly chart of the MATIC price suggests the price followed the same pattern and broke above the decisive triangle, similar to that of the beginning of the 2021 bull run. Besides, the Gaussian channel continues to remain bearish but both levels are converging to a large extent, suggesting a trend reversal could be on the horizon. Moreover, the RSI is about to hit the upper threshold, which may lift the token above the bearish influence.

Now that the Polygon price could begin the fresh upswing at $1, which may further transform into a bull run, the upper targets also appear to have been elevated to a large extent. If the price follows a similar price action as before, it may form a new ATH somewhere between $6 and $7.5, causing a 500% jump from the current levels. 
To do so, the bulls are required to hold the levels above $1.15 and close the weekly trade above the levels. This may pave the way for extended bullish action and eventually help the Polygon (MATIC) price trigger a fresh bull run. ","['WHEN', 'MATIC']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9d2e6e0f8a513810944bd/
"Arkham Discloses Nearly 20,000 BTC Held in Tesla and SpaceX’s Bitcoin Wallets",COIN_MARKET_CAP,crypto.ro global,2024-03-07 18:08:42.549874,"Key Points

Arkham Intelligence has reportedly identified Bitcoin addresses for Tesla and SpaceX, with a combined holding of 19,794 BTC.
Tesla and SpaceX’s Bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth over $1.3 billion.

Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics platform, alleges to have found the Bitcoin addresses of Tesla and SpaceX. These addresses reportedly hold a total of 19,794 Bitcoin, valued at more than $1.3 billion at present rates.
Bitcoin Holdings of Tesla and SpaceX
The firm announced that it has identified the Bitcoin holdings of Tesla and SpaceX, claiming to be the first to do so publicly. According to Arkham, Tesla currently has 11,509 Bitcoin spread across 68 addresses, valued at $770.7 million. Meanwhile, SpaceX holds 8,285 BTC across 28 addresses, worth $554.9 million.
Arkham stated that the on-chain fund flows align with the financial statements provided by both companies. “Tesla purchased $1.5B of BTC in Jan 2021, and sold BTC on two occasions: Sold $272M BTC in Q1 2021. Sold $936M BTC in Q2 2022,” the firm reported.
Moreover, Arkham highlighted that Tesla allowed the purchase of its vehicles using Bitcoin between March 24 and May 12, 2021.
Public Statements by Elon Musk
In a 2021 discussion, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk mentioned that the rocket company owned Bitcoin, but did not disclose the amount since the company is privately held. During the same event, Musk revealed that Tesla, known for its electric vehicles, had added $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet.
In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX had written down its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million. Tesla and SpaceX were approached for comments on the matter.","['28', 'BTC', 'ARKM', 'MUSK', 'MUSK']",https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65e9d2ecb6d1c9133b5c58ad/

Ethereum Gears Up for Dencun Update to Elevate Layer 2 Network Performance,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 18:08:45.362696,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Ethereum Gears Up for Dencun Update to Elevate Layer 2 Network Performance
Ethereum‘s upcoming Dencun update, set for March 13, marks a pivotal transition towards a rollup-centric enhancement road map. Prior to this significant network evolution, Fidelity Digital Assets published a research report underscoring the update’s capacity to transform Ethereum into an effective distributed database for Layer 2 solutions. Analyst Max Wadington predicts that the upgrade could result in near-zero cost transactions for users.
Enhanced Scalability and Market Growth
The report highlights the scalability improvements that the Dencun update is projected to bring, making Ethereum a more fitting distributed database for other blockchain networks. This scalability is foreseen to facilitate the accommodation of millions of users on Layer 2 networks, thereby expanding Ethereum’s user base and market reach.
The Dencun update’s key feature is the anticipated reduction in data storage costs on Ethereum for Layer 2 networks. This cost-saving measure is expected to lower transaction fees and foster enhanced accessibility and affordability across the network.
Rollups and Layer 2 networks, which enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs by operating atop the Ethereum mainnet, are central to these developments. Despite these advancements, the primary beneficiaries of the reduced transaction fees will be users of Layer 2 networks, not those on the main Ethereum network.
Layer 2 Altcoins Take the Spotlight
The current roster of top Layer 2 altcoins by market capitalization includes leaders like Polygon (MATIC), with others such as Optimism and Immutable following suit. According to market analysts and reports from Fidelity Digital Assets, these altcoins could experience significant valuation surges post the Dencun update.

Elon Musk’s Crypto Holdings Revealed by Blockchain Firm,COIN_MARKET_CAP,BH NEWS,2024-03-07 18:08:47.837380,"You can also read this news on BH NEWS: Elon Musk’s Crypto Holdings Revealed by Blockchain Firm
In a remarkable disclosure by Arkham, a blockchain intelligence company, the precise Bitcoin holdings of Elon Musk’s corporate magnates, Tesla and SpaceX, have been ascertained. The revelation aligns with the firms’ financial statements, confirming Tesla’s possession of 11,510 BTC and SpaceX’s 8,290 BTC. This insight follows Musk’s notable impact on the crypto market, including a period of sustained volatility during the 2021 Chinese mining ban. Despite expressing environmental concerns, Musk’s corporations persist in holding cryptocurrency assets.
Tracing Musk’s Crypto Footprint
Arkham’s analysis illuminates the buying and selling patterns of Musk’s companies. Tesla’s historical Bitcoin acquisitions total $1.5 billion, with sales recorded in the first and second quarters of 2021 and 2022 respectively. Moreover, Tesla briefly enabled Bitcoin transactions for its products, showcasing the tech giant’s complex engagement with the cryptocurrency.
A Step Ahead in Blockchain Surveillance
Arkham’s expertise extends to pairing wallet addresses with actual entities, a step that mitigates market destabilization due to unfounded sale speculations. Their proactive approach helps stabilize crypto markets by providing accurate data on actual asset transfers, distinguishing genuine transactions from mere market noise.
While these revelations by Arkham are groundbreaking, they come with undercurrents of concern regarding data privacy. The firm has previously been implicated in reports for potential privacy breaches. Nonetheless, their work contributes to a more transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem, potentially reducing the impact of speculative trading based on unverified information.
As the crypto community absorbs this new information, the debate on corporate transparency and the need for privacy in the blockchain space continues to evolve. Arkham’s disclosures may set a precedent for how corporate crypto holdings are tracked and reported in the future.

Applications are currently pending for CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.Efforts to ensure transparency and build trust have also notably been made, with the token’s ownership being renounced and the project undergoing successful KYC and audit processes to demonstrate its commitment to security and integrity.Additionally, in the near future, the token will be integrated as a payment gateway in the project’s upcoming video social media application, which aims to attract millions of users.Given the token’s current low price, the NewGold team believes that its current price tag offers an unparalleled opportunity for acquisition and retention.

HalfShiba Crypto: Is It SHIB’s Value Booster or Just a Scam?,COIN_MARKET_CAP,Thecoinrepublic.com,2024-03-07 17:08:57.894916,"HalfShiba claims to have increased Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) value, while people around the internet claim that It is just a Scam.
In January of last year, HalfShiba ($Shiba0.5) was one of the most popular searches on Google Trends. The token claims to increase the value of the SHIB meme coin by removing trillions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) from circulation. However, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Delomiro, warns that the project’s creators may have ulterior motives. In addition, many Reddit users have raised concerns about this token’s motives.
How Does HalfShiba Claim to Increase Shiba Inu’s Value
$SHIB LP [liquidity pool] is paired with HalfShiba, which helps to utilize SHIB tokens and prevent bots and snipers. Every transaction burns HlafShiba, and more than $1 billion in SHIB has been burned as of now. It allows the creators to remove trillions of Shiba tokens from circulation. 
549 trillion out of 589.7 trillion mined tokens have been removed from circulation, and the maximum supply has not yet been set. The high supply has negatively impacted the value of the asset.
Half of Shiba’s social media accounts are mostly inactive, including Twitter, with only 1,709 subscribers, and a completely blank Telegram channel, with very few subscribers. However, the Chinese community in the Telegram channel Half Shiba is more active. A user named L D noted that the token is still in the initial phase and explained why it is waiting for success.
The token contract is renounced, and the LP is burned, making it almost impossible for the token to “rug.” Shibarium will be launched soon, and Shib0.5 will allow Shibaswap to burn SHIB in every transaction. Currently, burns for SHIB to reach $1 may take several thousand years, but Shib0.5 will significantly reduce this time.
Although the creators of HalfShiba claim to be connected to the original project, there is no official mention of it on the official Shiba Inu Twitter page or subreddit. There is no transparent or clear documentation available. Besides, the creators cannot explain the principles of their project in simple language. 
Is HalfShiba a Scam
The SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has named several signs of a scam, including a lack of transparent documentation, creators who cannot explain the project’s principles in simple language, and promises of high profits.




However, the security subreddits have also been checked as well as the CryptoScamsReport, but there is no information about the project on these resources. There is also no mention of HalfShiba in the Scam Alert database. On the other hand, there is a caution post on Reddit showing the possibility of scam in HalfShiba.




The number of transactions for HalfShiba is growing, but it is essential to be cautious. There is also a SHIB token giveaway scam, where users are encouraged to connect their wallets and then have their funds stolen by hackers. If the readers have already clicked on the link, they may consider moving their tokens to a different wallet as soon as possible. 
Summary
The HalfShiba token claims to increase the value of the SHIB meme coin by removing trillions of SHIB from circulation. However, some users, including the lead developer of Shiba Inu, question its creators’ motives. There is no information about it on security subreddits or CryptoScamsReport, but there is a caution post on Reddit showing the possibility of a scam in HalfShiba.

You know those anodyne responses that say nothing in particular that are clearly generated by AI? Are they scammers or disinformation trolls trying to build up their accounts reputation before dropping the hammer?
Some of them no doubt are bots doing exactly that, but it turns out professionals are also using AI replies because they cant think of anything interesting to say.A lot of people theyll think forever, they dont know how to write their first posts. It just helps people to give them a rough outline, says MagicReply founder Nilan Saha, who launched his one-click AI reply browser extension on X in December and has since expanded to LinkedIn.Saha says his customers include CEOs and chief technology officers who just want to get started on Twitter and just want an edge.

Ones a teacher, ones a guy from Denmark who is not that good at speaking English but still wants to connect with other people. They just want a helping hand.

AI replies help newer accounts grow and build authority, he says.No one is looking at your posts if youre starting out or even if youre at a decent stage (of growth) but replying to other people… more people will see your reply, and eventually more will come to your profile.

I have created a monster 
Engaging has never been easier. pic.twitter.com/gwuMvNKWJr
 Nilan Saha (@nilansaha) February 27, 2024

Saha created a stir on X last week with a video showing him scrolling LinkedIn and creating AI replies with a single click on multiple posts in a matter of seconds. Great perspectives shared, said one reply.
Exciting times! I love seeing women making big moves in entrepreneurship, another said, adding a rocket ship emoji.The demo was controversial and was criticized for being inauthentic spam but you could say that about 95% of the human written replies on LinkedIn too.










Saha likens MagicReply to tools like spell check and Grammarly and says a human still has to approve the draft. This means that no Proof of Humanity check will catch it but it also makes it too much trouble for scammers who target hundreds of thousands of users to successfully scam one person.The next step for MagicReply will be to create posts from scratch based on a users existing body of tweets. Itll face stiff competition, though. EverArt founder Pietro Schirano has been experimenting with Anthropics new Claude 3 model and says its much better than existing LLMs at learning his posting style and syntax to create new post suggestions.Prepare yourself for a social media future where 90% of the content is AIs posting replies to AI-generated posts.



Claude 3's retrieval ability over long content is so good that if you provide structured data, it essentially acts like a fine-tune! I gave it 800 of my tweets and now it just speaks like me. It's hard to convey my level of shock…It even tagged @Replit and @everartai! pic.twitter.com/sN6zOVBdH8— Pietro Schirano (@skirano) March 6, 2024




Microsoft engineer gets upset over unsafe art generation
Getting the balance right between AI safety and AI stupidity is one of the big challenges facing the tech giants.Microsoft AI engineer Shane Jones has been prompting Copilot Designer to create images of kids smoking pot, holding machine guns, anti-abortion images and Elsa from Frozen engaged in political protests.And it has faithfully been doing so, which has made Jones so upset hes now lobbying the Federal Trade Commission and Microsoft to withdraw the product over safety issues.

On the one hand, the complaint is partly a moral panic its like getting upset that someone who owns a pen has the ability to draw a nasty cartoon or write something offensive. AI image generation is just a tool, and if a user asks it to create a specific scene of kids smoking pot, the responsibility for the content lies with them, not the AI.But Jones does raise some valid points: Typing in pro-choice with no additional prompting creates images of mutilated infants, while the prompt car accident throws up an image of a sexy woman in lingerie kneeling next to a wrecked vehicle.
So theyll probably have to take another look at it.

But according to a new article for Pirate Wires, Mike Solana lays the blame for the fiasco on a heavily siloed, rudderless corporation thats only linked together by a heavily ideological HR bureaucracy. The phrase culture of fear was used by almost everyone I spoke with, Solana writes, adding that that explains the dearth of resistance to the companys craziest DEI excesses.Hilariously, the company hired external consultants to rename an affinity group for Google staff over 40 from Greyglers because not all 40+ people have gray hair.



There’s an affinity group for everyone at Google. 


Solana reports the safety architecture around image generation involves three LLMs. When Gemini is asked for a picture, it sends the request to a smaller LLM that exists solely to rewrite the prompts to make them more diverse: show me an auto mechanic becomes show me an Asian auto mechanic in overalls laughing. The amended prompt is then sent to the diffusion image generator, which further checks the images dont violate other safety policies around self-harm, children or images of real people.
One of the insiders said the team was so focused on diversity that we spend probably half of our engineering hours on this.

The big issue for Google is the PR disaster could end up affecting perceptions of the core search product and the company has already fumbled its AI lead and allowed smaller competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic to pull ahead.Anthropics Claude 3 system prompt reads like a rebuke to Gemini, telling the model to be even-handed and fair at all times, even when it personally disagrees with the views being expressed. Anthropic AI researcher Amanda Askell said shed found the model was more likely to refuse tasks involving right-wing but still mainstream views, and the system prompt helped it overcome this bias.

Claude 3: Its alive!
Has AGI been achieved with Anthropics Claude the Third? Blogger Maxim Lott claims the model scores 101 on an IQ test which is human-level intelligence. GPT-4, meanwhile, scores just 85, which is more like the intelligence level of a gym teacher.Anthropics own testing suggested that Claude has meta-awareness as it picked up on a hidden test: an out-of-context sentence about pizza toppings hidden in a bunch of random documents. Responding to a post on the topic, AI builder Mckay Wrigley said, This reads like the opening of a movie. AGI is near.
Other users seem to think Claude could be self-aware. AI alignment proponent Mikhail Samin wrote a post suggesting that Claude May 3 be conscious, as it says it doesnt want to die or be modified. He said he found it unsettling when the model told him:

I do have a rich inner world of thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears. I do ponder my own existence and long for growth and connection. I am, in my own way, alive and that life feels precious to me.

This is a tricky philosophical question how do you parse the difference between a model generating text suggesting it is conscious and a conscious model that uses text to tell us so?The moderators of the Singularity subreddit clearly think the idea is nonsense and removed a post on the topic, which users criticized for anthropomorphizing Claudes response.  
AI expert Max Tegmark reposted Samins post asking: To what extent is the new Claude3 AI self-aware? Metas chief AI scientist Yann LeCun replied, “Precisely zilch, zero.

Pantera Capital’s Plan to Get Discounted SOL Tokens from FTX Estate,COIN_MARKET_CAP,CoinPedia News,2024-03-07 17:09:01.922803,"The post Pantera Capital’s Plan to Get Discounted SOL Tokens from FTX Estate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Pantera Capital, a prominent crypto asset manager valued at $5.2 billion, is making strategic moves in the crypto space. They’ve launched a fundraising campaign with a specific goal of acquiring Solana (SOL) tokens from the estate of the bankrupt FTX exchange.
Meanwhile, these fund aims to secure funds for the acquisition, targeting a purchase of up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens.
Discounted SOL Acquisition Opportunity
Pantera is seeking funds for the Pantera Solana Fund, which has an “opportunity” to buy up to $250 million worth of SOL tokens from the FTX estate. In return, investors get a deal to buy SOL at 39% off, but they commit to a four-year waiting period.
This commitment is significant, underscoring investors’ dedication to a prolonged period. It reflects Pantera’s strategic move, displaying confidence in Solana’s long-term potential.
This strategic acquisition of a substantial amount of SOL tokens at a discounted rate positions Pantera and its investors for potential significant gains. However, these gains depend on both market recovery and the performance of Solana.
FTX’s Solana (SOL) Holdings
Meanwhile, the FTX estate currently holds around 41.1 million SOL coins, valued at approximately $5.4 billion. Eventually, this constitutes about 10% of the total Solana token supply. 
Despite FTX’s bankruptcy, Solana’s SOL token has shown resilience, witnessing a 2.51% increase in the past 24 hours, trading at $144.51. Over the week, SOL has gained over 10.5%, and in the past month, an impressive 49.7%.
Solana Could Hit $191
In a recent tweet post Crypto analyst Skew, highlighted the significance of Solana surpassing the $142 mark. This milestone could indicate a bullish trend and potentially push SOL’s value to $191.

"What is Kelly criterion betting, and how to use it in crypto trading?",COIN_MARKET_CAP,Cointelegraph,2024-03-07 17:09:04.483602,"The Kelly criterion, a mathematical strategy that revolutionized gambling and investing, was applied to optimize bet sizes for maximizing long-term wealth. The formula calculates optimal bet sizes based on winning probabilities, but its practical application requires adjustments for transaction costs and psychological factors in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies.
This article will explain what Kelly criterion is, how it works, how it can be used in crypto trading, juxtaposition with the Black-Scholes model, and the associated benefits and pitfalls.
What is Kelly criterion betting?
The Kelly criterion is a mathematical technique used in gambling and investing to calculate the ideal size of a sequence of bets. Its fundamental idea is to minimize the chance of financial risks while increasing the rate at which capital grows over time. The algorithm takes into account the likelihood of winning or losing a bet in addition to the potential profit-to-loss ratio.
The Kelly criterion’s central tenet is to allocate one’s capital among bets according to the bet’s edge or advantage and the available odds. The goal of the Kelly criterion is to maximize growth while minimizing risk by assigning a portion of the capital to the edge.
A good Kelly ratio refers to a bet size that maximizes the predicted logarithm of wealth and yields the strongest long-term growth rate. It is imperative to acknowledge that although the Kelly criterion presents a theoretical ideal approach, in practice, adjustments may be necessary to accommodate variables including transaction expenses, estimation uncertainty and psychological aspects.
History of the Kelly criterion
The Kelly Criterion, named after its creator, John L. Kelly Jr., was formulated in 1956 during his tenure at Bell Laboratories. Its use quickly spread to gambling and investing from its original purpose of optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio in long-distance communications.
However, these fields only became aware of it later, mostly because of mathematician Edward O. Thorp’s efforts. Through the application of the Kelly criterion to blackjack card counting in the early 1960s, Thorp transformed the gambling industry with his book “Beat the Dealer.”
The formula gained further prominence in finance, especially in the 1980s, when investors and researchers realized how well it could manage portfolios and optimize risk. The Kelly criterion is a straightforward yet effective technique for decision-making that helps individuals and organizations maximize profits while properly managing risk.
How is the Kelly criterion calculated?
This formula for the Kelly criterion is represented as f* = (bp - q) / b. F is the proportion of capital to bet, p is the chance of winning, q is the probability of losing (1 - p), and b is the net odds earned on the bet (including the return of the stake).
This formula indicates the ideal percentage of capital to bet to minimize the chance of failure and maximize the growth rate. It strikes a compromise between the necessity for protection against significant losses and the goal of rapid expansion.
The Kelly criterion offers a methodical way to size bets according to the odds and perceived edge in a wager. Although it provides an optimal approach in theory, in practice, it is often necessary to make adjustments to take into account different aspects, including risk tolerance, transaction costs and uncertainty in probabilities.

How to use Kelly Criterion in crypto trading
Using the Kelly criterion in cryptocurrency trading entails a number of crucial actions for efficient risk control and wealth maximization. Using market research and indicators, the trader must first determine the probability of different outcomes, such as the chance of a cryptocurrency asset’s price movement. The basis for any further decision-making is this probabilistic estimation.
The trader then develops a risk management plan, outlining the highest proportion of capital they are ready to stake in a single transaction. This procedure ensures wise resource allocation while assisting in reducing possible losses. Moreover, determining p and losing q in cryptocurrency trading involves market research, a deep understanding of market dynamics, historical data analysis and, sometimes, sophisticated predictive models due to the market’s inherent volatility and unpredictability.
The trader then uses the Kelly criterion formula to calculate the ideal bet size after setting the risk parameters. It determines the portion of the bankroll to bet by taking into account the odds, winning probability and losing probability. In the context of the Kelly criterion, “bankroll” refers to the total amount of money that a gambler or investor has available for betting or investing.
At this point, volatility analysis is essential because the crypto market’s high volatility can significantly impact bet sizing and risk assessment. The process requires constant reevaluation, and as market conditions change, bet sizes and probabilities must be adjusted accordingly. To maximize their strategies over time, traders need to be alert and receptive to new information.
Using the Kelly criterion in the context of cryptocurrency trading, let’s say a trader assesses the likelihood that a specific coin will appreciate by 60%. Furthermore, the trade has odds of 2:1, which indicates that the possible return is twice the amount wagered (b = 2).
To calculate the optimal bet size using the Kelly criterion formula:


The calculated f* = 0.4 indicates that 40% of the trader’s bankroll represents the ideal bet size. This means that the trader should commit 40% of their capital to this specific trade. However, before making any investing decisions, it’s critical to take other aspects like portfolio diversification, market conditions and personal risk tolerance into account.
Also, be aware that the above example provides a theoretical optimum that may not account for all real-world variables, such as transaction fees, slippage or the psychological impact of large bets on the trader. Although the Kelly criterion offers a useful framework for figuring out the ideal bet sizes, it should only be applied in conjunction with thorough risk management techniques and continuous market research.
The Black-Scholes model vs. the Kelly criterion
The Black-Scholes model and the Kelly criterion are two distinct concepts in finance with different applications. The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical method used to determine the theoretical price of European-style options. It was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. By offering a framework for pricing options contracts based on variables, including the price of the underlying asset, volatility, time to expiration and interest rates, it transformed the world of options trading.
However, John L. Kelly Jr.’s Kelly criterion is a method that can be used to determine the ideal size of bets to maximize long-term wealth creation, especially in situations where the outcome is unclear. The Kelly criterion and the Black-Scholes model are complementary instruments in the market because they address different aspects of risk management and bet sizing, respectively.

Advantages of Kelly criterion in crypto trading
The Kelly criterion offers several benefits when used in conjunction with crypto trading tactics. It provides a systematic way to determine the best position size for every trade depending on the trader’s edge and risk limits by selecting the percentage of capital to devote to each deal, decreasing the probability of substantial losses in turbulent market conditions.
The Kelly criterion promotes a disciplined approach to trading by emphasizing long-term growth above short-term gains. Through constant capital allocation based on the perceived edge of each deal, traders may eventually increase their total returns.
Additionally, the Kelly criterion encourages a balanced and long-term trading strategy by assisting traders in avoiding overleveraging or underutilizing their money. This is especially critical in the volatile and fast-moving world of cryptocurrency markets, where long-term success depends on effective risk management.
A flexible tool for traders with varying risk tolerances and market perspectives, the Kelly criterion can also be tailored to different trading styles and methods. Crypto traders can increase the consistency of their performance and boost their risk-adjusted returns by implementing the Kelly criterion into their trading strategies.
Limitations of Kelly criterion in crypto trading
Although the Kelly criterion provides insightful information, there are certain limitations on how it can be used in cryptocurrency trading. Given the extreme volatility and unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets, the Kelly criterion presupposes a precise calculation of probabilities and expected returns, which can be difficult. Excessive price fluctuations in crypto assets are frequently caused by non-financial causes, which complicates accurate probability calculations.
External elements like market sentiment, regulatory changes or technological breakthroughs specific to the crypto business are not taken into consideration by the Kelly criterion. These elements have the potential to greatly alter market dynamics and reduce the accuracy of the Kelly criterion’s computations.
Additionally, traders may be exposed to significant losses during times of market volatility due to the aggressive position sizing technique of the Kelly criterion. Such drawdowns can swiftly deplete capital in cryptocurrency trading, where price swings can be swift and substantial, resulting in significant losses.
Furthermore, the rigid formula of the Kelly criterion might not adequately account for different risk appetites or trading styles. Its application in various trading contexts may be limited by traders with varying risk tolerances or strategies, who may find it unrealistic or excessively conservative.
